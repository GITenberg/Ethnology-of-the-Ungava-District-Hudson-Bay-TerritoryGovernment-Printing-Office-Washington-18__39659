<p>At the time this article was written, the Ungava district was part of
the Northwest Territories. It was transferred to Quebec in 1912. As of
spring 2012, Ungava corresponds loosely to the Nunavik administrative
division; maps may show either name.</p>

<p>Ungava bay is on the northern coast of old Labrador&mdash;the last
great bight of the strait between the ocean and the mouth of Hudson bay.
Its chief affluent is Koksoak or South river, which is several hundred
miles long and takes its rise in a picturesque festoonery of lakes
looped through the highlands half way down to Quebec.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_chimo" id = "intro_chimo">
FORT CHIMO AND THE SURROUNDING REGION.</a></h4>

<p>Fort Chimo is in longitude 68° 16´ west of Greenwich and latitude
58°&nbsp;8´ north. The post is on the right bank of the Koksoak river,
about 27 miles from its mouth. The elevation of the level tract on which
the houses are situated is but a few feet above high-water mark. The
location was selected on account of its comparative dryness, and also
because the river affords a safer anchorage in that vicinity than lower
down.</p>

<p>The early Moravian missionaries, long before established on the
Atlantic coast, desired to extend their labors for the conversion of the
Eskimo to their teachings. About the year 1825 a vessel ascended the
Koksoak river for the purpose of selecting a new missionary station.
Nearly opposite Fort Chimo is a beacon, yet standing, erected by the
people of that vessel. Their reception among the natives was such that
they gave a glowing account of it on their return. The Hudson Bay
Company immediately took steps to erect a trading post upon the river,
and a small party was sent in the year 1831 from Moose Factory to
establish a trading post where the trade would appear to promise future
development. The men remained there, obtaining a precarious subsistence,
as the vessel delivering them supplies visited that place only once in
two years. Their houses were simple, consisting of a single structure
for the official in charge, another for the servants, and two more for
the storage of goods. A&nbsp;palisade was erected around the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page168" id =
"page168">168</a></span>
houses to prevent the intrusion of the natives, Indians and Eskimo, who
were so lately at war with each other that the rancorous feeling had not
subsided and might break out afresh at any moment without warning. The
remnants of the palisade were yet visible in 1882. The establishment of
this trading post had a pacifying influence upon the natives, who soon
found they could do better by procuring the many valuable fur-bearing
animals than by engaging in a bloody strife, which the traders always
deprecate and endeavor to prevent or suppress. After many trials to
establish an overland communication with the stations on Hamilton inlet,
it was found to be impracticable, and in 1843 the station was
abandoned.</p>

<p>John M’Lean, in a work entitled “Twenty-five Years in the Hudson’s
Bay Territory,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> gives an account of that portion of the country that came
under his knowledge from the year 1838 to 1843.</p>

<p>In the year 1866 the steamer <i>Labrador</i> was built and sent with
a party to reestablish the post at Fort Chimo. Since 1866 the post has
been a paying station, and in later years a good profit has been
made.</p>

<p>Fort Chimo is the chief trading station of the Ungava district. The
Ungava district proper is the area embraced by the watershed whose
outflow drains into Ungava bay. The eastern boundary is formed by the
foothills on the west side of the coast range, which is the western
limit of Labrador. This range has a trend northwest and southeast to
latitude 60°, where it makes a somewhat abrupt angle and pursues a
nearly north course, terminating with Cape Chidley and the Buttons, the
latter a low group of islets some 7 miles north of the cape. The
southern boundary is the “Height of Land,” near latitude 55°. This
region is estimated to be from 1,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The
greater portion of it is comparatively level, and on its surface are
innumerable lakes of various sizes, some of which are quite large. The
western boundary is not so well known in the southern part of the
region, as it has been seldom traversed. It seems to be a high elevation
extending toward the north-northwest, as numerous streams run from the
southwest and west toward the central or Koksoak valley. Eskimo who have
traversed the region many times report that the elevated land abruptly
ends near 58°&nbsp;30´, and that there is formed a wide swampy tract,
estimated to be about 80 miles wide, which opens to the northeast and
southwest. The northwestern portion of the district is a great area
abounding in abrupt hills and precipitous mountains of various heights.
These heights, estimated to range no higher than 2,600 feet, terminate
abruptly on the western end of the strait, and the numerous islands in
that portion of the water are, doubtless, peaks of this same range
continuing to the northwest.</p>

<p>It will be thus seen that the district of Ungava is a huge
amphitheater opening to the north. The interior of the district is
excessively varied by ridges and spurs of greater or less elevation. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page169" id =
"page169">169</a></span>
farther south one travels, the higher and more irregularly disposed are
the hills and mountains. These spurs are usually parallel to the main
ranges, although isolated spurs occur which extend at right angles to
the main range. The tops of the higher elevations are covered with snow
for the entire year. The summits of the lower ones are shrouded with
snow as early as the 1st of September, and by the 1st of October the
snow line descends nearly to their bases. The lower lands are full of
swampy tracts, lakes, and ponds.</p>

<p>The more elevated regions are totally destitute of vegetation, except
the tripe des roches, which gives to the hills a somber color, anything
but inspiring. Fully three-fourths of the more elevated region is, with
the exception of black lichens, barren rock. Everywhere is the evidence
of long continued glacial action. The southern exposures of all the
hills show the same character of wearing, and, in many instances,
a&nbsp;fine polish on the rocks forming their bases. This smoothness
extends nearly to the summits of the higher peaks. These again are
somewhat rougher and often broken into jagged, angular fragments,
frequently of immense size. The more moderate elevations are usually
rounded summits on whose higher portions may be found huge bowlders of
rock having a different character from that upon which they rest,
proving that they were carried there by masses of ice in the glacial
ages. The northern extremity of all the ridges and spurs indicate that
the glacial sheet moved to the north-northwest, for these portions of
the rocks are so jagged and sharp edged as to appear to have been broken
but yesterday.</p>

<p>The rivers of this district are numerous and several are of great
size, although but two of them are navigable for more than 100 miles,
and this only for boats of light draft.</p>

<p>The river usually known as George’s river (Kan´gûk¢lua´luksoak) is
the largest on the eastern side. This stream takes its rise about
latitude 55° and pursues a moderately tortuous course nearly northward
and falls into the eastern side of Ungava Bay. It has a wide bay-like
mouth narrowing rapidly at the mouth proper. Swift rapids are formed
here on account of an island near the center. Beyond this the river
expands and has an average width of half a mile for a distance of about
18 miles where the river bends eastward and forms rapids for over 2
miles. It is navigable for the steamer <i>Labrador</i> only about 12
miles. Beyond the rapids it runs tolerably smooth and deep for nearly 40
miles and thence to the source is a series of rapids and falls,
rendering portages frequent, and making it utterly impracticable for
even a heavy skiff to ascend beyond 70 miles from the mouth. Indians
assert that high falls occur about 150 miles from the mouth of the
George’s river. The water is said to fall from a terrific height, almost
perpendicularly, and it causes the ground to tremble so that the
thundering noise may be heard for more than a day’s journey from it.</p>

<p>The tide at the mouth of George’s river rises 53 feet, and at the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page170" id =
"page170">170</a></span>
Anchorage, opposite the newly established station of Fort George, some
12 miles from its mouth, 42 feet.</p>

<p>Whale river is the next important river toward the east. Off the
mouth of this river is a huge island, locally known as Big island. This
high island extends parallel to the course of the river, and a reef,
connecting its upper end with the mainland, becomes dry at low water.
The course of Whale river is not well known. About 40 miles up this
stream it suddenly contracts and becomes a mere creek, forming the
outlet of a large lake, whose position is not satisfactorily determined.
It is to the banks of this lake that certain families of the Indians
repair for summer fishing.</p>

<p>The next large river is the Koksoak. This stream is the largest in
the district. It takes its rise from lakes situated on the
plateau&mdash;the “Height of Land,”&mdash;and pursues a course having a
general direction north-northeast. On emerging from the lake it is
rather small, but forks and unites again about 40 miles below. The
current <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘is / is’ at line break">is</ins>
sluggish at the upper end, and the eastern branch is so
narrow that the Indians have to part the overhanging alders and willows
to afford their canoes a passage. This branch is said to be the shorter
way to the lake and is not so difficult to ascend, the eastern branch
being shallow and containing a number of rapids.</p>

<p>Below the junction of the branches the river rapidly becomes larger
and contains several very high falls, below which the river flows
northwest for a couple of hundred yards and then curves to the
north-northeast for a distance of 5 miles. This portion is only about
700 feet wide. It then turns abruptly westward and rushes swiftly
through a narrow gorge only 200 feet wide for a distance of about 7
miles. This course is noted for several rapids, through which a boat can
not make its way without great difficulty. At the end of this 7-mile run
the river again bends abruptly to the east, and continues that course
with little northing until the last bend, some 65 miles below, is
reached. At the lower end of the 7-mile run the ledges and reefs are too
numerous to count. From this place to the mouth of the Larch river the
Koksoak is obstructed by islands, bars, and shoals. Below these,
however, it becomes quite broad, until nearly opposite the high point or
promontory below the mouth of the Larch (Pl.&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">XXXVI</span>). From this locality it is monotonous till the
last bend is reached, some 4 miles above Fort Chimo, where it suddenly
turns to the north and pursues that direction to the sea with little
variation. At the last bend, however, a&nbsp;large island, locally known
as Big island, not only obstructs but ends navigation for boats drawing
over 6 feet. Small boats, such as skiffs and native boats, ascend to the
lower end of 7-mile run. The principal obstruction to travel in any kind
of vessel in the Koksoak from Big island to the mouth of the Larch river
is the presence of two falls or rapids about 40 miles from Fort
Chimo.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page171" id =

feet 3 inches. The usual rise and fall is from 8 to 12 feet less,
depending on the stage of the river. At Fort Chimo the tide rises as
much as 31 feet. The backwater is held in check as far as the upper
rapids in a common stage of water, and during a high rise in the month
of June the water is “backed” some 3 miles beyond the upper rapids.</p>

<p>The branches of the Koksoak river are few and unimportant. The larger
tributary is the Larch river. It is a rapid and almost unnavigable
stream of variable depth, mostly shallow, and 100 to nearly 400 yards
wide.</p>

<p>At about 40 miles from its mouth the Larch forks, the lower or
southwest fork draining the eastern sides of the same mountains whose
western slopes are drained by the Little Whale river. This southwest
fork of the Larch river is quite small and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘scarely’">scarcely</ins> capable of being ascended,
although it may, with great caution, be descended. This is the course
followed by the Little Whale river Indians when they traverse the
country to join the Naskopies of the Koksoak valley. The northwest
branch of the Larch is still smaller and is reported to issue from the
swampy tract of land in about latitude 58°&nbsp;30´.</p>

<p>The next large river is the Leaf. Its mouth is about 34 miles
northwest of Fort Chimo, and it flows into a peculiarly shaped bay named
Tass´iyak, or “like a lake.” The length of the river proper is estimated
to be but 40 miles, flowing from a very long and narrow lake, having its
longer axis extending southwestward and draining the greater part of the
swampy tract lying in latitude 58°&nbsp;30´. The southwestern portion of
this tract is merely an area covered with innumerable small lakes so
intimately connected by short water courses that it is difficult to
determine whether water or land constitutes the greater part of the
area. The rivers to the west are of less importance and drain the rugged
area forming the northwestern portion of the district, or that part
lying under the western third of Hudson strait.</p>

<p>The principal portion of Hudson strait that came under my observation
is Ungava bay. This bay is a pocket-shaped body of water lying south of
the strait and toward its eastern end. Soundings in various portions of
this bay indicate a depth of 28 to 70 fathoms for the central area. The
bottom appears to be uniformly the washings from the freshwater streams.
The extreme tides of Hudson strait tend to produce the most violent
currents in this bay. Opposite the entrance of Leaf river bay is a
whirlpool of considerable size, which causes much trouble to navigation.
It is safe enough at high water but very dangerous at half-tide.</p>

<p>The large island known as Akpatok lies in such a position as to break
much of the current along the south side of the middle of the strait,
but to give additional force to the currents at either end. This island
is about 100 miles long and has an average width of 18 miles. It is the
largest island in the strait proper.</p>

<p>The coast line of the northwest portion of the mainland is
imperfectly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page172" id =
"page172">172</a></span>
known, as is the western coast forming the eastern shore of Hudson bay.
Navigation in any portion of Hudson strait is attended with much danger,
not alone from the tremendous energy of the tides but also from the
quantity of ice to be found at all times. During the months of August
and September the strait is comparatively free from large fields of ice,
but after that date the harbors, coves, and other anchorages are apt to
be frozen up in a single night.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro_climate" id = "intro_climate">
CLIMATE.</a></h4>

<p>The temperature is controlled by the direction of the wind. The
warmest winds are southeast, south, and southwest during the summer. The
northeast winds bring (if&nbsp;backing) fog, rain, or snow; the north
wind is usually cold and disposed to disperse the clouds. The northwest
wind is always very cold in winter and chilly in summer. Westerly winds
are moderate in winter and summer. The southerly winds are warm at all
seasons if blowing hard, but very cold if blowing lightly in winter.
I&nbsp;think the coldest light winds of the winter are from a point
little west of south. They are doubtless due to the cold from the
elevated region&mdash;the Height of Land.</p>

<p>The greatest amount of cloudiness occurs in the spring and fall;
rather less in July and August, and least during December, January, and
February. The average cloudiness for the entire year is not less than
eighty-two hundredths of the visible sky.</p>

<p>Sleet falls mostly from the middle of September to the beginning of
December. Snow then succeeds it and continues to be the only form of
precipitation until the middle of April, when sleet and snow fall until
the first rain sets in. The season of rain is very erratic. It may rain
by the first of May, but rarely does. Snow falls every month in the
year; the 2d of July and the 6th of August were the dates farthest apart
for this form of precipitation. The character of the rain is usually
moderate to hard for the summer showers; although several notable
exceptions of abundant dashes occur during late June and all of July.
The August and September rains are usually light to moderate, but often
persistent for several days. The snowfalls are light to heavy in
character, rarely, however, lasting more than twenty-four hours. The
sleet is usually precipitated in severe squalls. The lower grounds are
permanently covered with snow by the 1st of December, this covering
remaining until the 10th of June. At the latter date only the heavier
drifts and the snow of the ravines remain. It entirely disappears by the
last of July at all elevations no higher than that of Fort Chimo.</p>

<p>The higher hills retain snow until the last of August, but none is to
be seen in the vicinity of Fort Chimo after that date. By the middle of
September snow again covers the tops of the distant high hills.</p>

<p>Fogs rarely occur so far inland as Fort Chimo. Those occurring are in
July and August. At times they are very dense; and, as they form during
the earliest hours of the day, they are usually dissipated by 4
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page173" id =
"page173">173</a></span>
to 7 a.&nbsp;m. While the ice is setting in the river, and driven back
and forth by the tides, huge volumes of steam arise from the inky water
and are spread over the land by the light winds prevailing at that
season. This moisture deposited on the bushes and trees forms a most
beautiful sight.</p>

VEGETATION.</a></h4>

<p>The northern limit of trees on the Labrador coast is in latitude 57°.
Here the conifers are stunted and straggling. Beyond the coast range
they attain a slightly higher altitude and thence continue to a point
about thirty miles north of the mouth of George’s river. On the western
side of the mouth of this river the trees are pushed back 15 to 20 miles
from the sea. At the mouth of Whale river, the trees attain a height of
30 to 50 feet on the eastern (right) bank and within 2 miles of the
shore. On the left bank the trees do not approach to within 10 to 15
miles of the coast. At the mouth of False river they form a triangular
extension and attain considerable size, due in great measure to the
peculiar formation of a huge amphitheater whose north wall serves as an
admirable protection against the cold winds from the bay. On the western
side of False river the tree line extends in a southwesterly direction
across the Koksoak and to the banks of the Leaf river nearly at its
source from the large lake. From the south side of this lake the trees
are very much scattered and attain inconsiderable size, scarcely fitted

forms the northern limit of trees for the northwest portion of the
region. The people (Eskimo only) who dwell north of this line are
dependent upon the stunted willows and alders, growing in the deeper
ravines and valleys having a southern exposure. Large pieces of wood are
much sought for by the Eskimo of the northwest portion, for use in
constructing their kaiaks, umiaks and paddles, as well as spear shafts
and smaller requirements for which the distorted stems of willow and
alder will not suffice.</p>

<p>South of the line given as the northern limit of trees the growth
slowly attains greater size and extension of area. The timber north of
the Height of Land is comparatively small, the spruce and larch rarely
attaining a size greater than 12 to 15 inches at the ground and rapidly
tapering up for 2 feet or so above the surface. Above the height of 2
feet the stems slowly taper and, in a few instances, produce symmetrical
stems for more than 15 feet. The trees growing within 40 miles of Fort
Chimo seldom exceed 10 inches in diameter, and of the larger
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page174" id =
"page174">174</a></span>
trunks the logs are selected to form the material from which the walls
of all the buildings at that place are constructed.</p>

<p>The alders, willows, and a few other bushes attain a greater or less
size, depending upon the situation and amount of protection afforded.
I&nbsp;have seen as large stems of these shrubs growing within a mile of
Fort Chimo as I have seen at either Davis inlet or Rigolet.</p>

<p>The flowering plants are sparsely scattered over the northern areas,
and then only in most suitable soils. The ground remains frozen from the
last of October&mdash;earlier some seasons&mdash;to the last of May, or
even into the middle of June. The appearance of the annuals is sudden,
and they rapidly attain their full size and quickly fall before the
chilling winds of autumn.</p>

<h5><a name = "intro_animal_mammals" id =
"intro_animal_mammals">MAMMALS.</a></h5>

<p>The marine mammals alone appear to be well known, but the number of
cetaceans can certainly be increased above the number usually reported
inhabiting the waters immediately bordering upon the region.</p>

<p>The phocids are best known for the reason that off the shores of
southeast Labrador the pursuit of species of this family is carried on
each spring to an extent probably surpassing that anywhere else on the
face of the globe.</p>

<p>At the mouth of Little Whale river, the white whale is taken to the
number of 500 each year, although the capture is steadily decreasing.
The Indians here do the greater part of the labor of driving, killing,
flaying, and preserving them. At Fort Chimo another station for the
pursuit of white whales is carried on. Here the Eskimo do the driving
and killing, while the Indians perform the labor of removing the blubber
and rendering it fit for the oil tanks into which it is placed to put it
beyond the action of the weather. The skin of the white whale is tanned
and converted into a leather of remarkably good quality, especially
noted for being nearly waterproof.</p>

<p>Of the land mammals, the reindeer is probably the most abundant of
all. It is found in immense numbers in certain localities, and forms for
many of the inhabitants the principal source of subsistence, while to
nearly all the residents its skins are absolutely necessary to protect
them from the severity of the winter.</p>

<p>The black, white and brown bears are common enough in their
respective areas. The former rarely ranges beyond the woodlands, never
being found so far north as Fort Chimo. The white bear is common in the
northern portions bordering the sea and is occasionally found as far
south as the strait of Belleisle, to which it has been carried on
icebergs or fields of ice. Akpatok island and the vicinity of Cape
Chidley are reported to be localities infested with these brutes. The
brown or barren-ground bear appears to be restricted to a narrow area
and is not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page175" id =
"page175">175</a></span>
plentiful, yet is common enough to keep the Indian in <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">wholsome</ins> dread of its
vicious disposition when enraged.</p>

<p>The smaller mammals occur in greater or less abundance according to
the quality and quantity of food to be obtained. The wolves, foxes, and
wolverines are pretty evenly distributed throughout the region. The
hares are found in the wooded tracts for the smaller species and on the
barren regions for the larger species.</p>


<h5><a name = "intro_animal_birds" id =
"intro_animal_birds">BIRDS.</a></h5>

<p>The actual residents were ascertained to be less than twenty species
for the northern portion of the Ungava district.</p>

<p>Of the actual residents the two species of the genus <i>Lagopus</i>
are the most abundant of all birds in the region, and form an important
article of food for all classes of people inhabiting the district. The
winter exerts an important influence on the smaller resident species.
During the winter of 1882-’83 the number of the four species obtained of
the genus <i>Acanthis</i> was almost incredible. Their notes might be
heard at any time during that season, which was cold, though regularly
so, and not specially stormy. In the winter of 1883-’84 not a single
individual was observed from the middle of November to the last of
March. The same remarks may well apply to the white-winged crossbill
(<i>Loxia leucoptera</i>), which was very abundant the first winter, but
during the last winter a very small flock only was observed and these
were apparently vagrants.</p>

<p>Among the water birds, certain species which were expected to occur
were conspicuously absent. The character of the country forbids them
rearing their young, as there is little to feed upon; and only a few
breed in the immediate vicinity of Fort Chimo. Among the gulls, <i>Larus
argentatus smithsonianus</i> is certainly the only one breeding in
abundance within Ungava bay. Of the terns, the Arctic tern (<i>Sterna
paradiseæ</i>) was the only one ascertained to breed in Hudson strait.
I&nbsp;am not certain that they do breed there every year. Although I
saw them in early July, 1883, under conditions that led me to believe
that they were on their way to their nests, yet it was not until 1884
that a number of eggs were secured near that locality.</p>

<p>Of the smaller waders, but two species were actually ascertained to
breed in the vicinity of Fort Chimo, yet two or three other species were
observed under such circumstances as to leave no doubt that they also
breed there.</p>

THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY&mdash;GENERAL SKETCH.</a></h3>


<h4><a name = "native_eskimo" id = "native_eskimo">
THE ESKIMO.</a></h4>

<p>The northern portions of the coast of the region under consideration
are inhabited by the Eskimo, who designate themselves, as usual, by the
term “Innuit,” people (plural of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘innuls’">innuk</ins>,* “a&nbsp;person”). That they
have been much modified by contact with the whites is not to be doubted,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page176" id =
"page176">176</a></span>
and it is equally certain that their language is constantly undergoing
modifications to suit the purposes of the missionary and trader, who,
not being able to pronounce the difficult guttural speech of these
people, require them to conform to their own pronunciation. The region
inhabited by the Innuit is strictly littoral. Their distribution falls
properly into three subdivisions, due to the three subtribal
distinctions which they maintain among themselves. The first subdivision
embraces all the Innuit dwelling on the Labrador coast proper and along
the south side of Hudson strait to the mouth of Leaf river, which flows
into Ungava bay.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
* This is probably a transcription error: script “k” misread as
“ls”.</p>

<p>These people apply the term Sû hi´ nĭ myut to themselves and are thus
known by the other subdivisions. This term is derived from
Sû&nbsp;hi´&nbsp;nûk, the sun, and the latter part of the word, meaning
people (literally “those that dwell at or&nbsp;in”); hence, people of
the sun, sunny side, because the sun shines on them first. At the
present time these people are confined to the seashore and the adjacent
islands, to which they repair for seals and other food. South of
Hamilton inlet I could learn of but one of these people.</p>

<p>The Innuit of pure blood do not begin to appear until the missionary
station of Hopedale is reached. Here a number of families dwell,
although mostly at the instigation of the missionaries. Between this
station and Hebron are several other Moravian missionary stations, at
each of which dwell a greater or less number of pure Innuit. North of
Hebron to Cape Chidley there are but few families, some seven in all,
embracing a population of less than 40 souls. On the west side of Cape
Chidley, as far as the mouth of George’s river, only about eight
families live. These with the George’s river Innuit comprise less than
50 individuals. There is a stretch of coast bordering Ungava bay, from
George’s river to the Koksoak river, which is uninhabited.</p>

<p>The Koksoak river people include only four or five families and
number less than 30 souls. The next people are those dwelling at the
mouth of Leaf river, but they are more properly to be considered under
the next subdivision.</p>

<p>The exact number of the Sûhĭnĭmyut could not be definitely
determined. They are subdivided into a number of small communities, each
bearing a name compounded of the name of their home and myut, “the
people of.”</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Cape Chidley are known as Ki lĭn´ĭg myut, from the
word ki lĭn´ĭk, wounded, cut, incised, lacerated; hence, serrated, on
account of the character of the rough rocks and mountains.</p>

<p>The natives of George’s river are known as Kan´gûk¢lua´luksoagmyut;
those of the Koksoak river are known as Koksoagmyut.</p>

<p>The second subdivision includes the Innuit dwelling on the area lying
between the mouth of Leaf river, thence northward, and along the south
side of Hudson strait. Their western and southern limit extends to about
latitude 60°.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page177" id =
"page177">177</a></span>
<p>These Innuit are known by the other subdivisions as Ta hág myut. They
apply the same term to themselves. The word is derived from Tá&nbsp;hak,
a&nbsp;shadow; hence people of the shade or shadow as distinguished from
the Sû&nbsp;hĭ´&nbsp;nĭ&nbsp;myut, or people of the light or sunshine.
These people are but little influenced by contact with the white
traders, who apply to them the term “Northerners.” Their habits and
customs are primitive, and many appear to be entirely distinct from the
customs of their neighbors south and east. The character of the region
in which they dwell is very rugged. Huge mountain spurs and short ranges
ramify in every direction, forming deep valleys and ravines, along which
these people must travel to reach the trading station of Fort Chimo of
the Ungava district, or else to Fort George of the Moose district.</p>

<p>The distance to the former is so great that only three, four, or five
sledges are annually sent to the trading post for the purpose of
conveying the furs and other more valuable commodities to be bartered
for ammunition, guns, knives, files and other kinds of hardware, and
tobacco. Certain persons are selected from the various camps who have
personally made the trip and know the trail. These are commissioned to
barter the furs of each individual for special articles, which are
mentioned and impressed upon the mind of the man who is to effect the
trade. The principal furs are those of the various foxes. Among them are
to be found the best class of silver foxes, and wolverenes and wolves.
Those to be sent are procured the previous winter, and when the snow
falls in November or early December the line of sleds starts out for the
trading post. The sled which represents the wants of the more western of
these Innuit speeds to where the second may be, and they repair to the
place of meeting with the third, and thus by traversing the line of
coast the arctic caravan is made up. Provisions are supplied by the
wayside, and when all is in readiness a southern course is traveled
until the frozen morasses on the south of the hills are reached. Thence
the course is toward Leaf river and across to Fort Chimo. By the last
week of April or the first week of May the visitors are expected at the
trading post. They usually bring with them about two-fifths of all the
furs obtained in the district; indeed, the quantity often exceeds this
amount. They seldom remain longer than the time needed to complete their
bartering, as the rapidly melting snow warns them that each day of delay
adds to their labor in returning.</p>

<p>The homeward journey is more frequently made along the coast, as
there the snow is certain to remain longer upon the ground. It is not
infrequent that these travelers experience warm weather, which detains
them so long that they do not reach the end of their journey until the
middle of the summer or even until the beginning of the next winter.
Many of the Innuit who accompany these parties have never seen white men
until they arrive at Fort Chimo; women are often of the party. These
people are usually tall and of fine physique. The men are larger
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page178" id =
"page178">178</a></span>
than the average white man, while the women compare favorably in stature
with the women of medium height in other countries.</p>

<p>They have quite different customs from those of their present
neighbors. Their language is dialectically distinct; about as much so as
the Malimyut differ from the Kaviagmyut of Norton Sound, Alaska. The
Tahagmyut have a rather harsh tone; their gutturals are deeper and the
vowels usually rather more prolonged. They are much given to amusement
and still retain many of the old games, which the Sûhĭ´nĭmyut have
forgotten or no longer engage in. Their dead are treated with no
ceremony. They simply lash the limbs of the deceased to the body and
expose the corpse to the elements, removing it, however, from immediate
sight of the camp. Old and infirm people are treated with severity, and
when dependent upon others for their food they are summarily disposed of
by strangulation or left to perish when the camp is moved.</p>

<p>Women are held in little respect, although the men are very jealous
of the favors of their wives, and incontinence on the part of the latter
is certain to be more or less severely punished. The male offender, if
notoriously persistent in his efforts to obtain forbidden favors, is
usually killed by the injured lover or husband.</p>

<p>Gambling is carried on to such a degree among both sexes that even
their own lives are staked upon the issue of a game. The winner often
obtains the wife of his opponent, and holds her until some tempting
offer is made for her return. The only article they possess is
frequently wagered, and when they lose they are greeted with derision.
The women, especially, stake their only garment rather than be without
opportunity to play. The usual game is played with a number of flattened
pieces of walrus ivory. On one side are a number of dots forming various
crude designs, which have received names from their fancied resemblance
to other objects. These must be matched. The game somewhat resembles
dominoes, and whether it is original with these Innuit I was unable to
conclude. They stoutly maintain that it originated with themselves.
I&nbsp;suspect, however, it had its origin in the imitation of some one
who had observed the playing of dominoes on board of some of the whaling
vessels visiting these waters.</p>

<p>For other amusements these Innuit indulge in a number of tests of
personal strength, such as wrestling and leaping.</p>

<p>Feasts are held at stated times in huge structures built of snow
blocks. The exact signification of these feasts was not learned, owing
to the limited stay these people made each year at Fort Chimo. Their
dress consists of the skins of seals and reindeer. The sealskins are
worn during rainy weather and by those who are in the canoe or kaiak.
The skirts of their garments are ornamented with an edging of ivory
pieces cut into a pear-shape, having a small hole pierced through the
smaller end.</p>

<p>These pieces of ivory, often to the number of many scores, give a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page179" id =
"page179">179</a></span>
peculiar rattle as the wearer walks along. Their boots are noticeably
different from those made by the Koksoak river people, inasmuch as the
soles are often made with strips of sealskin thongs sewed on a false
sole, which is attached to the under surface of the sole proper. The
strips of thong are tacked on by a stout stitch, then a short loop is
taken up, and another stitch sews a portion of the remainder of the
strip. This is continued until the entire under surface consists of a
series of short loops, which, when in contact with the smooth ice,
prevents the foot from slipping. This sort of footgear is not made in
any other portion of the district.</p>

<p>The third subdivision comprises the Innuit dwelling on the eastern
shore of Hudson bay, between latitudes 53° and 58°.</p>

<p>The number of these Innuit could not be definitely ascertained, as
they trade, for the most part, at Fort George, belonging to the Moose
district. Each year, however, a&nbsp;party of less than a dozen <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘indiviuals’">individuals</ins>
journey to Fort Chimo for the purpose of bartering furs and other
valuables. Those who come to Fort Chimo are usually the same each year.
In language they differ greatly from the Koksoak Innuit, inasmuch as
their speech is very rapid and much harsher. Many of the words are quite
dissimilar, and even where the word has the same sound it is not unusual
that it has a meaning more or less different from that used by the
Koksoak Innuit. As these people have been long under the advice and
teachings of the missionary society of London, it is to be expected that
they, especially those nearer the trading station, are more or less
influenced by its teachings. Their customs differ somewhat from the
other Innuit, though this is due in a great measure to the impossibility
of procuring the necessary food, and skins for garments, unless they are
constantly scouring the plains and hills for reindeer or the shore for
seals and other marine creatures.</p>

<p>These people are called by their neighbors and themselves I´tivi´
myut, Iti´vûk signifies the other, farther, distant side (of&nbsp;a
portion of land); hence, the word Itivimyut means people of the other
side. The northern Itivimyut are probably the most superstitious of all
the Innuit dwelling in the region under consideration.</p>

<p>Although the missionaries have devoted considerable energy to the
work of converting these people, and though many of them profess
Christianity, these professions prove on examination to be merely
nominal. As soon as the converts are beyond the teacher’s influence,
they return to the shaman for guidance.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1883 a party of these people visited Fort Chimo.
A&nbsp;great number of the Koksoak people were ill, some 30 miles above
the station. The visitors had among them a shaman renowned throughout
the land. He, with the connivance of two or three of the people with
whom he stopped, began some of the most astonishing intrigues to dispel
the evil spirit afflicting the people. Several men were parted from
their wives, and these were compelled to dwell with other men
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page180" id =
"page180">180</a></span>
who were at the bottom of the conspiracy. Other couples had to flee from
that place to prevent being divorced, at least temporarily. After a time
the visitors descended to Fort Chimo, and while the bartering was going
on the shaman announced his conversion to Christianity, and vowed never
again to return to practicing shamanism. On the return of the harried
fugitives they passed the camp of the Koksoak river people, where they
had a few days before been the guests, and stole their supplies of
reindeer meat and other valuable property, even attempting to purloin a
kaiak; and they had proceeded many miles thence before they were
overtaken and compelled to relinquish the stolen property. They were
seen some months after by some Tahagmyut, to whom they stated their fear
of returning among the Koksoak people. A&nbsp;more plausible scamp does
not dwell in those regions than this shaman, whose name is Sápa. His
power over the spirit controlling the reindeer is widely believed in and
invoked by the other shamans, who feel incapable of turning the heads of
the deer and thus compelling them to wander in the desired
direction.</p>

<p>Among these people only have I heard of a son who took his mother as
a wife, and when the sentiment of the community compelled him to discard
her he took two other women, who were so persecuted by the mother that
they believed themselves to be wholly under her influence. She even
caused them to believe they were ill, and when they actually did become
so they both died.</p>

<p>In former years the Innuit extended entirely around the shore of
Hudson bay. Now there is a very wide gap, extending from the vicinity of
Fort George, on the eastern coast, to the vicinity of Fort Churchill, on
the western coast. At the present time the Innuit occupy the areas
designated in these remarks. That they formerly extended along the
Atlantic coast far to the south of their present limit is attested by an
abundance of facts.</p>

<p>The Innuit of the eastern shore of Hudson bay, the Itivimyut,
informed me that the Innuit dwelling on the islands of Hudson bay, more
or less remote from the mainland to the east, are termed Ki´gĭktag´myut,
or island people. They relate that those islanders have quite different
customs from the mainland people, inasmuch as their clothing consists of
the skins of seals and dogs, rarely of reindeer skins, as the latter are
procurable only when one of their number comes to the shore to trade for
such articles as can not be obtained on his locality. The spear, kaiak,
bow and arrow are used, and they have but little knowledge of firearms.
These people are represented as often being driven to greatest extremity
for food. It is said that their language differs considerably from that
of their neighbors.</p>

<p>The Innuit, as a rule, are peaceful and mild-tempered, except when
aroused by jealousy. They are, however, quick enough to resent an insult
or avenge an injury. They form a permanent attachment for the white man
who deals honestly and truthfully with them, but
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page181" id =
"page181">181</a></span>
if he attempts any deception or trickery they are certain to be ever
suspicious of him, and it is difficult to regain their favor.</p>

<p>Their courage and ability are not to be doubted, and when they are
given a due amount of encouragement they will perform the most arduous
tasks without complaint.</p>


<h4><a name = "native_indians" id = "native_indians">
THE INDIANS.</a></h4>

<p>The Indian inhabitants of this region may be divided into three
groups, differing but slightly in speech, and even less in habits.</p>

<p>(1) The Mountaineers, “Montagnais” of the early Jesuit missionaries,
roam over the areas south of the Hamilton inlet and as far as the Gulf
of St. Lawrence. Their western limits are imperfectly known. They trade
at all the stations along the accessible coast. Many of them barter at
Rigolet and Northwest river.</p>

<p>In customs they differ little from the Indians to the north of them.
Their means of subsistence are the flesh of reindeer, porcupines, and
various birds, such as geese, ducks, ptarmigan, and grouse.</p>

<p>The habits of the reindeer in this portion of the country are very
erratic. They are often absent from large tracts for several years, and
appearing in abundance when little expected. The scarcity of the
reindeer renders the food supply quite precarious; hence, the Indians
rely much upon the flesh of the porcupine, hare and birds for their
principal food.</p>

<p>Their clothing is of the tanned skin of the deer when they are able
to procure it. As nearly all the skins of the reindeer are used for
garments, few are prepared for other purposes; hence the northern
stations (Fort Chimo) furnish great numbers of these skins in the
parchment condition to be purchased by the Mountaineers, who cut them
into fine lines for snowshoe netting and other purposes.</p>

<p>They procure the furs of marten, mink, fur beaver, muskrats, lynxes,
wolverines, wolves, and foxes. A&nbsp;considerable number of black bears
are also obtained by these Indians. By the barter of these furs they
procure the articles made necessary by the advent of the white people
among them. They are quiet and peaceable. Many of them profess a regard
for the teachings of the Roman missionaries, who have visited them more
or less frequently for over a hundred and fifty years. I&nbsp;was unable
to obtain the term by which they distinguish themselves from their
neighbors. That they are later comers in the region than the Innuit is
attested by the bloody warfare formerly carried on between them, of
which many proofs yet exist. The Mountaineers applied to the more
northern Indians the term of reproach, “Naskopie.” This word denotes the
contempt the Mountaineers felt for the Naskopies when the latter failed
to fulfill their promise to assist in driving the Innuit from the
country.</p>

<p>It was impossible to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the numbers of
the Mountaineers. My stay in their vicinity was too short to learn as
much about them as was desired.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page182" id =
"page182">182</a></span>
<p>(2) The Indians dwelling to the southwest of the Ungava district
differ rather more than the Mountaineers, in their speech, from the
Indians of the Ungava district. They average, for both sexes, slightly
taller than the Naskopies. The men are spare, and have small limbs and
extremities. The cheek bones are also more prominent, although this is
partly due to the thin visage. The women are disposed to be stout, and
in the older women there is a decided tendency to corpulence. The
complexion, too, is considerably darker. The men wear long hair, usually
cut so as to fall just upon the shoulders. The hair of the women is
quite heavy, and is worn either in braids or done up in folds upon the
side of the head.</p>

<p>In their personal habits they are much more tidy than their eastern
relations. Their dress differs but little from that of their neighbors.
The women dress in cloth made of material procured from the traders, and
some of these appear respectable enough when so dressed. They have been
so long in contact with the white people at Moose Factory, some of whom
had brought their wives from home with them, that the women have
imitated the dress of the latter. Certain of these women are skillful in
working fancy articles. The men occupy their time in hunting and
fishing. The reindeer have in recent years become so scarce in the
vicinity of Fort George that many of the Indians have left that locality
and journeyed to the eastward, dwelling in proximity to the Naskopies,
or even with them.</p>

<p>Both sexes are mild and sedate, although the women are exceedingly
garrulous when well acquainted.</p>

<p>These Indians are often employed to assist in the capture of the
white whale, which ascends the lower portions of the larger streams of
that district. They are the only Indians whom I have seen eating the
flesh and blubber of these whales. The Naskopies will not touch it,
declaring it to be too fat. The fins and tail are portions highly prized
while they are helping render out the blubber of these whales at Fort
Chimo.</p>

<p>A point of great dissimilarity between the Naskopies and the Little
Whale river Indians is that the birch-bark canoe of the latter is much
more turned up at each end, producing a craft well adapted to the swift
currents of the rivers. The occupants are skillful boatmen, and will
fearlessly face wind and wave that would appall the heart of the
Naskopie. Sails are sometimes erected in a single canoe. At times two
canoes are lashed together and a sail spread from a single mast. This
double boat is very convenient for the traveler. These people are
strongly addicted to the practice of polygamy; and while they are
Christians externally, they are so only as long as they are within the
reach of the missionary.</p>

<p>Among those who had come to dwell in the Ungava district were several
who had, because of the opportunity, taken two wives. The missionary,
E.&nbsp;J. Peck, suddenly appeared among them as he was on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page183" id =
"page183">183</a></span>
his way to London. On learning of the conduct of the people he gave them
a sound rating and besought them to relinquish the practice. They
assented, and sent the second wives away until the missionary was out of
the country, and then they took them back.</p>

<p>Girls are often taken as wives before they attain puberty, and for
this reason they seldom have large families. Two, three, or four
children form the usual number for each family. They are satisfied if
the first child is a male; and to the mother who delivers only female
children a term of contempt is often applied. The women appear to be
well treated, and occasional laxity of morals is not noticed among them
so long as it is not notorious.</p>

<p>Their beliefs and traditions were not learned by me, on account of
the presence of these people at Fort Chimo when other labors occupied my
entire time.</p>

<p>Their purchases are made with furs of the same kinds as those
procured in the Ungava district. The black bear is procured in great
numbers by these Indians. They preserve the under lip, dressed and
ornamented with beads and strips of cloth, as a trophy of their
prowess.</p>

<p>The harpoon used in striking the white whale of their rivers is an
implement doubtless peculiar to those people, and much resembles that of
the Innuit.</p>

<p>(3) The third division of Indians includes those dwelling for the
most part in the Ungava district. The total number of these Indians is
about 350. They apply the term Ne né not&mdash;true, ideal men&mdash;to
themselves, although known by the epithet Naskopie, which was applied to
them by the Mountaineers of the southeastern portion of the region.</p>

<p>They differ slightly in customs from their neighbors, but their
speech is somewhat different, being very rapidly uttered and with most
singular inflections of the voice. A&nbsp;conversation may be begun in
the usual tone, and in a moment changed to that of a whining or petulant
child. It is impossible for the white man to imitate this abrupt
inflection, which appears to be more common among the males than the
females. During ordinary conversation one would erroneously suppose,
from the vehemence of gesture, that the speaker was angry. They are much
more demonstrative than their neighbors, often shouting at the full
strength of their voices when an ordinary tone would apparently suffice.
That their voice is penetrating may be inferred from the fact that
during quiet days it is not unusual for parties to converse from
opposite sides of the Koksoak river, at Fort Chimo, where the river is
nearly a mile and a half wide.</p>

<p>As certain words are spoken in a voice scarcely louder than a
whisper, I&nbsp;did not believe it possible that they could understand
each other at so great a distance, until I saw the people on the
opposite shore doing what they were bidden by those with me.</p>

<p>When the women get together it is amusing to observe the eagerness
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page184" id =
"page184">184</a></span>
of the old crones endeavoring to make their voices heard above the rest.
The clerk, while trading with them, often teases them until the entire
number turn their voices on him, and the only relief he has is to expel
them all from the store and admit one or two at a time, while the
remainder throng the windows and shout at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>During the spring, when flocks of Canada geese are winging their way
northward, the Indians will imitate their notes so closely that the
birds do not discover the source until too late. Some of the party make
one note, while the others imitate the other note. It seldom fails to
beguile the geese to the spot.</p>

<p>Owing to the impossibility of getting a reliable person to teach me
the language of these people I was able to procure but few words. The
number obtained, however, is sufficient to prove that the people of this
region, excluding the Innuit and whites, belong to the Cree branch. The
Mountaineers and Little Whale river Indians belong to the same stock,
and the difference in their language is due wholly to environment.</p>

<p>The Indians and Innuit of this region are more or less directly in
contact. At Fort Chimo it is especially so. Here, as elsewhere, they do
not intermix, an Indian never taking an Innuit wife or the Innuit taking
a squaw for a wife. I&nbsp;knew of one instance where a Naskopie went to
dwell with some Innuit camped near the mouth of the Koksoak, but after
remaining away for a few days he returned to his own people.</p>

SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THE PEOPLE AROUND FORT CHIMO.</a></h3>


<h4><a name = "koksoagmyut" id = "koksoagmyut">
THE KOKSOAGMYUT.</a></h4>

<p>The Eskimo with whom I was brought in contact at Fort Chimo were
those belonging to that immediate vicinity. They term themselves
Koksoagmyut, or people of the Koksoak or Big river.</p>

<p>The people who apply this name to themselves do not number more than
a score and a half. There are but four families, and among these are
some who belong to other localities, but now dwell with the Koksoagmyut.
They consider themselves a part of the people dwelling as far to the
north as the western end of Akpatok island, and to the east as far as
George’s river. The Eskimo dwelling between those points have similar
habits, and range indiscriminately over the hunting grounds of that
locality, seldom going farther southward than the confluence of the
Larch river or the North river with the Koksoak.</p>

<p><a name = "kokso_physical" id = "kokso_physical">Among these few
natives</a> now inhabiting the Koksoak valley we find the men to be
above the stature usually ascribed to the Eskimo. All but one of the
adult males are above 5 feet 8 inches. The smallest man is little more
than 5½ feet tall. All are well proportioned and present an
exceptionally good physique. The females are also well proportioned,
and, in fact, appear to compare well with females of civilized
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page185" id =
"page185">185</a></span>
countries as far as their stature is concerned. The lower extremities of
both sexes really are shorter than the general appearance would
indicate, and thus the body is somewhat longer. The great individual
variation in the proportional length of the legs is doubtless the result
of the way infants are carried in the hood on the backs of the mothers.
In this constrained position the limbs were obliged to conform to the
shape of the body on which the child, in a manner, grew. While the limbs
are not decidedly curved, yet they are not so nearly under the body as
those of the whites. In walking, the inner edges of the feet often touch
each other, and, in a manner, tend to cause the boots to slip outward on
the feet.</p>

<p>The head, hands, and feet appear fairly proportioned; although, as a
rule, they have small hands and feet. The females have proportionally
smaller feet than hands. The head may seem larger than it really is, on
account of the flattened features of the face.</p>

<p>The average nose is large and flat, and the prominence of this organ
is often diminished by the wide cheeks and overhanging forehead. In most
cases the chin projects less than the nose. The average face is round
and flat, but there are exceptions, as I have seen one or two persons
whose faces were a regular oval, and with the exception of the flat
front, seen from a side view, were as well formed as one will meet among
other people.</p>

<p>The skin has the same differences of color as among white people. The
greater number of people are moderately dark, but this depends very
greatly on the season of the year. I&nbsp;have not seen any white people
so much changed as these are by the exposure to the summer sunshine. In
the winter they are confined to their huts and bleach to a lighter
color. A&nbsp;couple of weeks’ exposure renders them scarcely
recognizable as the same persons. The young children are usually lighter
than the adults, although some are quite dark. The hair is coarse, long
and abundant, and always straight.</p>

<p>The few half-breeds seen at Fort Chimo are the young children of the
male servants of the company, who have in two instances taken
full-blooded Eskimo women for wives and who were married by the agent of
the company. These children are quite pretty, the male favoring the
mother and the girl resembling the father. With these, as with the
children of natives, much depends on the cleanliness of the person. The
soot and other filth accumulating on their faces and hands, seldom
washed, of course modifies the appearance of the exposed portions of the
body. Some of the girls would be attractive enough if a copious amount
of water was used to remove the ridges of dirt which are too plainly
visible. The hands are often much disfigured from numerous cuts and
bruises, which, when healed over, leave a heightened scar of a whitish
color quite different in color from the surrounding tissue and often
presenting an unsightly appearance.</p>

<p>By the time puberty is attained the girls quickly change, and in a
few
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page186" id =
"page186">186</a></span>
years begin to show the result of their arduous life by the appearance
of wrinkles, haggardness, and general breaking down, which, although it
may progress slowly, is seldom recovered from.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the Innuit, the Koksoagmyut are usually peaceful and
mild tempered. Among themselves affrays are of rare occurrence. Jealousy
arouses the worst passions, and the murder of the offender is generally
the result. When a person becomes so bad in character that the community
will no longer tolerate his presence he is forbidden to enter the huts,
partake of food, or hold any intercourse with the rest. Nevertheless, as
long as he threatens no one’s life, but little attention is paid to him.
Should he be guilty of a murder, several men watch their opportunity to
surprise him and put him to death, usually by stoning. The executioners
make no concealment of their action, and are supported by public opinion
in the community.</p>

<p>In the case of a premeditated murder, it is the duty of the next of
kin to avenge the deed, though years may pass, while the murderer
pursues his usual occupations undisturbed, before an opportunity occurs
to the relative for taking him by surprise. Sometimes the victim is not
overcome and turns upon the assailant and kills him. The man, now guilty
of two murders, is suffered to live only at the pleasure of the people,
who soon decree his death. That murder is not approved, either by the
individual or the community, is well attested by the fact that the
island of Akpatok is now tabooed since the murder of part of the crew of
a wrecked vessel, who camped on that island. Such a terrible scene was
too much, even for them; and now not a soul visits that locality, lest
the ghosts of the victims should appear and supplicate relief from the
natives, who have not the proper offerings to make to appease them.</p>

<p>Aged people who have no relatives on whom they may depend for
subsistence are often quietly put to death. When an old woman, for
instance, becomes a burden to the community it is usual for her to be
neglected until so weak from want of food that she will be unable to
keep up with the people, who suddenly are seized with a desire to remove
to a distant locality. If she regains their camp, well for her;
otherwise, she struggles along until exhausted and soon perishes.
Sometimes three or four of the males retrace their steps to recover a
lost whip or a forgotten ammunition bag. They rarely go farther than
where they find the helpless person, and if their track be followed it
will be found that the corpse has stones piled around it and is bound
with thongs.</p>

<p>An old woman at Port Chimo had but one eye, and this was continually
sore and very annoying to the people with whom she lived. They proposed
to strangle her to relieve her from her misery. The next morning the eye
was much better and the proposed cure was postponed.</p>

<p>Cases of suicide are not rare, considering the few people of that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page187" id =
"page187">187</a></span>
locality. Pitching themselves from a cliff or producing strangulation
are the usual methods. Sometimes a gun is used. Remorse and disappointed
love are the only causes of suicide.</p>

<p>A man discovered, during a period of great scarcity <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘or’">of</ins> food, that while he went
in quest of food his wife had secretly stored away a quantity of fish
and ate of them during his absence only. Coming home unexpectedly, he
caught her eating and she endeavored to secrete the remainder. He
quietly went out of the snow hut and blocked up the entrance. She
inquired why he did so. His reply was for her to come out and she would
discover why it was done. His tone was not at all reassuring. She
remained within the hut and perished from starvation, knowing she would
be killed if she went out.</p>

<p>Instances are reported where, in times of great scarcity, families
have been driven to cannibalism after eating their dogs and the clothing
and other articles made of skins. Unlucky or disliked women are often
driven from the camp, and such must journey until they find relief or
perish by the wayside.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_diseases" id = "kokso_diseases">
DISEASES.</a></h5>

<p>The principal diseases from which these people suffer are pulmonary
troubles, chiefly arising from their filthy manner of living in crowded
huts, too ill ventilated to allow the escape of the odors emanating from
their own bodies and from accumulations of slowly decomposing animal
food. All openings must be closed as quickly as possible in order to
economize the heat within, for when once chilled it is difficult to
restore the house to the proper degree of warmth. An Eskimo would always
prefer to erect a new hut of snow rather than pass the night in one
which has been deserted for only a single night if the doorway has not
been tightly closed with a block of snow.</p>

<p>Within the walls, reeking with the exhalations of various putrid
matters, the people breathe and rebreathe the air filled with poisonous
gases; so fully one-half of the Eskimo die of pulmonary troubles. The
other prevailing diseases are those causing devitalization of the blood,
such as scurvy. Sores break out on the shoulders, elbows, knees, and
ankles. The ravages of these diseases proceed at an astonishing rate,
soon carrying off the afflicted person.</p>

<p>The means of relief usually employed are those which the shaman
(or&nbsp;conjurer, as he is locally known) is able to effect by working
on the imagination of the sick, who is in this condition easily
influenced. The will power of both the patient and shaman is stretched
to its utmost tension, and as faith with them, as with many others of
fairer skins, often produces more of the relief than the ministrations
of drugs or drafts, the cure is effected, or else the shaman, like the
physician, has not the devil on his side.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the disease is generally measured by the amount of
the patient’s worldly wealth.</p>


<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page188" id =
"page188">188</a></span>
<h5><a name = "kokso_marriage" id = "kokso_marriage">
MARRIAGE.</a></h5>

<p>A woman is married as soon after puberty as a male comes along who
has the requisite physical strength to force her to become his wife.
Many of the females are taken before that period, and the result is that
few children are born to such unions and the children are generally
weakly.</p>

<p>The ceremony between the couples is quite simple. The sanction of the
parents is sometimes obtained by favor or else bought by making certain
presents of skins, furs, and other valuables to the father and mother.
The girl is sometimes asked for her consent, and, if unwilling, often
enlists the sympathy of the mother, and the affair is postponed to a
more favorable opportunity, or till the suitor becomes disgusted with
her and takes somebody else.</p>

<p>If the parents are not living, the brothers or sisters must be
favorable to the union. There is often so much intriguing in these
matters that the exact truth can seldom be ascertained.</p>

<p>Where all obstacles are removed and only the girl refuses, it is not
long before she disappears mysteriously to remain out for two or three
nights with her best female friend, who thoroughly sympathizes with her.
They return, and before long she is abducted by her lover, and they
remain away until she proves to be thoroughly subjected to his will.
I&nbsp;knew of an instance where a girl was tied in a snow house for a
period of two weeks, and not allowed to go out. She finally submitted,
and they returned with the other couple, who were less obstreperous, and
doubtless went along to help their male friend and companion. The woman
left her husband in the course of two or three weeks, and when he was
asked about it he acknowledged that she had pulled nearly all the hair
from his head and showed numerous bruises where she had struck him. This
same woman was afterward tied to a sled to make her accompany the man
she subsequently chose as her husband, who wished her to go to another
part of the country. It was a lively time, some of the old women pushing
her and persuading, the younger ones doing all in their power to
obstruct her. Children are often mated at an early age, and I have known
of several instances where two friends, desirous of cementing their ties
of fellowship, engage that their children yet unborn shall be mated. In
such instances the children are always recognized as married, and they
are allowed by the parents to be so called. I&nbsp;knew a small boy of
less than seven years who always addressed a girl of apparently a year
older as his wife.</p>

<p>The marriageable age of the female varies greatly, although puberty
takes place early. I&nbsp;have known of a child of fourteen having
children. I&nbsp;heard of a half-breed girl, on the Labrador coast, who
became a mother a few months after the age of thirteen.</p>

<p>Monogamy is generally the rule, but as there are so many
counteracting influences it is seldom that a man keeps a wife for a
number of years. Jealousy resulting from a laxity of morals produces so
much
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page189" id =
"page189">189</a></span>
disagreement that one or the other of the parties usually leave with
little ceremony.</p>

<p>In rare instances, where there is a compatibility of temper and a
disposition to continence, the pair remain together for life.</p>

<p>Many of the girls bear children before they are taken for wives, but
as such incidents do not destroy the respectability of the mother the
girl does not experience any difficulty in procuring a husband.
Illegitimate children are usually taken care of by some aged woman, who
devotes to it all her energies and affections.</p>

<p>The number of children born varies greatly, for, although these
Eskimos are not a prolific race, a&nbsp;couple may occasionally claim
parentage of as many as ten children. Two or three is the usual number,
and many die in early childhood.</p>

<p>When the family is prosperous the husband often takes a second wife,
either with or without the approval of the first, who knows that her
household duties will be lessened, but knows also that the favors of her
husband will have to be divided with the second wife. The second wife is
often the cause of the first wife’s leaving, though sometimes she is
sent away herself. Three or four wives are sometimes attained by a
prosperous man, and one instance was known where the head of the family
had no less than five wives. The occupation of a single snow house by
two or three wives brings them into close intimacy and often produces
quarreling. The man hears but little of it, as he is strong enough to
settle their difficulties without ceremony, and in a manner better
adapted to create respect for brute strength than affection for him.</p>

<p>The females outnumber the males, but the relationship among the
Koksoagmyut is now so close that many of the males seek their wives from
other localities. This, of course, connects distant people, and
interchange of the natives of both sexes is common.</p>

<p>Separation of couples is effected in a simple manner. The one who so
desires leaves with little ceremony, but is sometimes sought for and
compelled to return. Wives are often taken for a period, and an exchange
of wives is frequent, either party being often happy to be released for
a time, and returning without concern. There is so much intriguing and
scandal-mongering among these people that a woman is often compelled by
the sentiment of the community to relinquish her choice and join another
who has bribed a conjurer to decide that until she comes to live with
him a certain person will not be relieved from the evil spirit now
tormenting him with disease.</p>

<p>The only way for the couple against whom such a plot has been laid to
escape separation is for them to flee to another locality and remain
there until the person gets well or dies, whereupon the conjurer
declares it was their cohabitation as man and wife which afflicted the
invalid. A&nbsp;designing woman will often cause a man to cast off the
legal wife to whom he is much attached and come and live with her. In
such
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page190" id =
"page190">190</a></span>
instances the former wife seldom resents the intrusion upon her
affections and rights but occasionally gives the other a severe
thrashing and an injunction to look to herself lest she be discarded
also. The children of the cast-off woman are frequently taken by her and
they go to live with her relatives as menials on whom devolve the labor
of severest kinds, she being glad to obtain the refuse of the hovel to
support her life in order that her children may be well taken care
of.</p>

<p>Some wives are considered as very “unlucky” and <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘ft’ invisible">after</ins> trial are cast off to
shift for themselves. A&nbsp;woman who has obtained the reputation of
being unlucky for her husband is eschewed by all the men lest she work
some charm on them.</p>

<p>In social relations the head of the family comes first, and the
oldest son second, the other sons following according to respective
ages.</p>

<p>The sons of the first wife, if there be more than one wife, take
precedence over those of the second or third wife. It may be that a man
has lost his first wife and takes another. The sons of these two are
considered as those of one wife so far as their relation to each other
is concerned. When the father becomes <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘superanuated’">superannuated</ins> or his sons are old
enough to enable him to live without exertion, the management of affairs
devolves on the eldest son, and to the second is delegated the second
place. Each may be occupied in different affairs, but the elder alone
chooses what he himself shall do.</p>

<p>If the father live to a great age, and some of the men certainly
attain the age of more than 80 years, he may have great grandchildren
about him, and these never fail to show respect for their ancestor.</p>

<p>All this family may dwell in a single tent, or in two or more tents.
Where the leader directs, there they all repair, although each one who
is at the head of a family may be left to employ himself as he may
prefer. These sons, with their wives and children, form a community,
which may have other persons added to it, namely, the persons who are
related to the wives of the sons. There may be but one community in a
locality, and this is locally known to the white people as the “gang” of
the head man.</p>

<p>Families whose members have decreased in number by death or by
marriage may seek the companionship of one of these communities for
protection. The new arrival at once acknowledges his dependence and is,
in a manner, under the influence, if not control, of the leader of the
community which he joins.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_children" id = "kokso_children">

<p>A new born babe must not be washed until six or eight hours have
elapsed. It is then placed to the breast and rarely gets any water to
drink until old enough to help itself to it.</p>

<p>The child may be named while yet in utero. There being no
distinctions for sex in names the appellation can scarcely be amiss.
Several names may be acquired from the most trivial circumstances. Old
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page191" id =
"page191">191</a></span>
names may be discarded and new names substituted or certain names
applied by certain people and not used by others.</p>

<p>Love for offspring is of the deepest and purest character. I have
never seen a disrespectful Eskimo child. Mothers and fathers never
inflict corporal punishment on their children, for these are early
taught to obey, or rather they are quick to perceive that their parents
are their protectors and to them they must go for assistance. Orphan
girls are taken as nurses for small children, and the nurse so employed
has seldom any trouble in controlling the child.</p>

<p>Among young children at play the greatest harmony prevails. An
accident resulting in sufficient harm to cause tears obtains the
sympathy of all, who strive to appease the injured child by offers of
the greatest share of the game, the little fellow often smiling with the
prospective pleasure while the tears yet course down his begrimed
cheeks. In a moment all is forgotten and joyous shouts sound merrily as
the chubby youngsters of both sexes redouble their exertion in playing
football or building toy houses in the newly fallen snow, where, on the
bed of snow within the wall of the hut, the doll of ivory, wood or rags
rolled into its semblance, plays the part of hostess whom they pretend
to visit and with whom they converse.</p>

<p>Among the younger boys and girls, of 10 or 12, there is a great
spirit of cheerful rivalry, to prove their ability to secure such food
as they are able to capture. If they can procure enough to purchase some
ammunition with which to kill ptarmigan they soon have a certain amount
of credit. This enables them to provide some coveted luxury for their
parents, who, of course, aid and encourage them to become successful
hunters. Within the huts the girls display their skill by sewing
fragments of cloth into garments for dolls or striving to patch their
tattered clothes.</p>

<p>The older boys look with contempt upon these childish occupations
and, to show their superiority, often torment the younger ones until the
father or mother compels them to desist. Pranks of various kinds are
played upon each other and they often exhibit great cunning in their
devices to annoy. These boys are able to accompany their elders on
hunting trips and run ahead of the team of dogs attached to the
sled.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_burial" id = "kokso_burial">BURIAL
CUSTOMS.</a></h5>

<p>When a person dies the body is prepared by binding it with cords, the
knees being drawn up and the heels placed against the body. The arms are
tied down, and a covering of deerskin or sealskin is wrapped around the
body and fastened. The nearest relatives on approach of death remove the
invalid to the outside of the house, for if he should die within he must
not be carried out of the door but through a hole cut in the side wall,
and it must then be carefully closed to prevent the spirit of the person
from returning. The body is exposed in the open air along the side of a
large rock, or taken to the shore or hilltop, where
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page192" id =
"page192">192</a></span>
stones of different sizes are piled around it to prevent the birds and
animals from getting at it. (See Fig.&nbsp;21.) It is considered a great
offense if a dog be seen eating the flesh from a body. In case of a
beloved child dying it is sometimes taken with the people to whom it
belonged if they start for another locality before decomposition has
progressed too far.</p>

<p>The dying person resigns himself to fate with great calmness. During
illness, even though it be of most painful character, complaint is
seldom heard; and so great is fortitude that the severest paroxysms of
pain rarely produce even a movement of the muscles of the
countenance.</p>

<p>The friends often exhibit an excessive amount of grief, but only in
exceptional instances is much weeping indulged in. The loss of a husband
often entails great hardships on the wife and small children, who eke
out a scanty living by the aid of others who are scarcely able to
maintain themselves.</p>

<p>These people have an idea of a future state and believe that death is
merely the separation of the soul and the material body. The spirits of
the soul go either up to the sky, “keluk,” when they are called
Kelugmyut, or down into the earth, “Nuna,” and are called “Nunamyut.”
These two classes of spirits can hold communication with each other.</p>

<p>The place to which the soul goes depends on the conduct of the person
on earth and especially on the manner of his death. Those who have died
by violence or starvation and women who die in childbirth are supposed
to go to the region above, where, though not absolutely in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page193" id =
"page193">193</a></span>
want, they still lack many of the luxuries enjoyed by the Nunamyut. All
desire to go to the lower region and afterwards enjoy the pleasure of
communicating with the living, which privilege is denied to those who go
above.</p>

<p>If death <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: may be intentional (subjunctive)">result</ins> from natural causes the spirit
is supposed to dwell on the earth after having undergone a probation of
four years rest in the grave. During this time the grave may be visited
and food offered and songs sung, and the offering, consisting of oil and
flesh, with tobacco for smoking and chewing, is consumed by the living
at the grave. Articles of clothing may also be deposited near the grave
for the spirit to clothe itself after the garments have disappeared in
the process of decay. It is customary to place such articles as may be
deemed of immediate use for the departed soul in the grave at the time
the body is interred. Ammunition, gun, kaiak and its appurtenances, with
a shirt, gloves, knife, and a cup from which to drink are usually so
deposited. The spirit of the dead man appropriates the spirits of these
articles as soon as they decay. It is often said when an article becomes
lost that so-and-so (mentioning his name), has taken it.</p>

<p>Some of the people prefer to expose their dead on the flat top of a
high point extending into the water. The remains of others are placed
along the shore and covered with rocks, while still others are taken to
the smooth ridges on which may nearly always be found a huge bowlder
carried by glacial action and deposited there. Here generally on the
south side the body is placed on the bare rocky ridge and stones are
piled around and upon it.</p>

<p>While these people have but little fear of the dead man’s bones they
do not approve of their being disturbed by others. The Indians, however,
are known to rifle the graves of Eskimo to obtain the guns, clothing,
etc., which the relatives of the deceased have placed there.</p>

<p>There are no such elaborate ceremonies pertaining to the festivals of
the dead among the people of Hudson strait as obtain among the Eskimo of
Alaska.</p>

RELIGION.</a></h5>

<p>Among these people there is no such person as chief; yet there is a
recognized leader who is influenced by another, and this last is the
conjurer or medicine-man. These two persons determine among themselves
what shall be done. It sometimes happens that slight differences of
opinion on the proper course to pursue collectively will cause them to
go in different directions to meet after a few months’ separation, by
which time all is forgotten and former relations are resumed.</p>

<p>All the affairs of life are supposed to be under the control of
spirits, each of which rules over a certain element, and all of which
are under the direction of a greater spirit. Each person is supposed to
be attended by a special guardian who is malignant in character, ever
ready to seize upon the least occasion to work harm upon the individual
whom
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page194" id =
"page194">194</a></span>
it accompanies. As this is an evil spirit its good offices and
assistance can be obtained by propitiation only. The person strives to
keep the good will of the evil spirit by offerings of food, water, and
clothing.</p>

<p>The spirit is often in a material form in the shape of a doll,
carried somewhere about the person. If it is wanted to insure success in
the chase, it is carried in the bag containing the ammunition.</p>

<p>When an individual fails to overcome the obstacles in his path the
misfortune is attributed to the evil wrought by his attending spirit,
whose good will must be invoked. If the spirit prove stubborn and
reluctant to grant the needed assistance the person sometimes becomes
angry with it and inflicts a serious chastisement upon it, deprives it
of food, or strips it of its garments, until after a time it proves less
refractory and yields obedience to its master. It often happens that the
person is unable to control the influence of the evil-disposed spirit
and the only way is to give it to some person without his knowledge. The
latter becomes immediately under the control of the spirit, and the
former, released from its baleful effects, is able successfully to
prosecute the affairs of life. In the course of time the person
generally relents and takes back the spirit he gave to another. The
person on whom the spirit has been imposed should know nothing of it
lest he should refuse to accept it. It is often given in the form of a
bundle of clothing. It is supposed that if in hunting somebody merely
takes the bag to hang it up the influence will pass to him. The spirit
is supposed to be able to exert its influence only when carried by some
object having life. Hence the person may cast it away for a time, and
during that period it remains inert.</p>

<p>Besides this class of spirits, there are the spirits of the sea, the
land, the sky (for be it understood that the Eskimo know nothing of the
air), the winds, the clouds, and everything in nature. Every cove of the
seashore, every point, island, and prominent rock has its guardian
spirit. All are of the malignant type and to be propitiated only by
acceptable offerings from persons who desire to visit the locality where
it is supposed to reside. Of course some of the spirits are more
powerful than others, and these are more to be dreaded than those able
to inflict less harm.</p>

<p>These minor spirits are under the control of the great spirit, whose
name is “Tung&nbsp;ak.” This one great spirit is more powerful than all
the rest besides. The lesser spirits are immediately under his control
and ever ready to obey his command. The shaman (or&nbsp;conjurer) alone
is supposed to be able to deal with the Tung&nbsp;ak. While the shaman
does not profess to be superior to the Tung&nbsp;ak, he is able to
enlist his assistance and thus be able to control all the undertakings
his profession may call for.</p>

<p>This Tung ak is nothing more or less than death, which ever seeks to
torment and harass the lives of people that their spirits may go to
dwell with him.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page195" id =
"page195">195</a></span>
<p>A legend related of the origin of the Tung ak is as follows:
A&nbsp;father had a son and daughter whom he loved very much. The
children fell ill and at last died, although the father did all in his
power to alleviate their sufferings, showing his kindness and attentions
to the last moment. At their death the father became changed to a
vicious spirit, roaming the world to destroy any person whom he might
meet, determined that, as his dear children died, none others should
live.</p>

<p>Tung ak visits people of all ages, constantly placing obstacles in
their pathway to prevent the accomplishment of their desires, and
provoking them beyond endurance so as to cause them to become ill and
die and go to live with him. Tung&nbsp;ak no longer knows his own
children and imagines all persons that he meets to be his children.
Famine, disease, and death are sent abroad to search for these lost
children.</p>

<p>People at last began to devise some means of thwarting the designs of
Tung&nbsp;ak and discovered that a period of fasting and abstinence from
contact with other people endowed a person with supernatural powers and
enabled him to learn the secrets of Tung&nbsp;ak. This is accomplished
by repairing to some lonely spot, where for a greater or less period the
hermit abstains from food or water until the imagination is so worked
upon that he believes himself imbued with the power to heal the sick and
control all the destinies of life. Tung&nbsp;ak is supposed to stand
near and reveal these things while the person is undergoing the test.
When the person sees the evil one ready to seize upon him if he fails in
the self-imposed task to become an “Angekok” or great one, he is much
frightened and beseeches the terrible visitor to spare his life and give
him the power to relieve his people from misfortune. Tung&nbsp;ak then
takes pity on him, and imparts to him the secret of preserving life, or
driving out the evil which causes death.</p>

<p>This is still the process by which the would-be shaman fits himself
for his supernatural duties.</p>

<p>The newly fledged angekok returns to his people and relates what he
has seen and what he has done. The listeners are awed by the recitals of
the sufferings and ordeal, and he is now ready to accomplish his
mission. When his services are required he is crafty enough to demand
sufficient compensation, and frankly states that the greater the pay the
greater the good bestowed. A&nbsp;native racked with pain will gladly
part with all of his worldly possessions in order to be restored to
health.</p>

<p>The shaman is blindfolded, or else has a covering thrown over his
head to prevent his countenance from being seen during the incantation.
The patient lies on the ground before him and when the shaman is worked
up to the proper state of frenzy he prostrates himself upon the
afflicted person and begins to chase the evil from its seat. The patient
often receives blows and jerks sufficiently hard to dislocate the
joints. As the spell progresses the shaman utters the most hideous
noises,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page196" id =
"page196">196</a></span>
shouting here and there as the evil flees to another portion of the
body, seeking a retreat from which the shaman shall be unable to
dislodge it. After a time victory is declared; the operator claims to
have the disease under his control, and although it should escape and
make itself again felt in the patient, the shaman continues until the
person either gets well or dies. If the former, the reputation of the
shaman is increased proportionally to the payment bestowed by the
afflicted one. If he dies, however, the conjurer simply refers his
failure to the interference of something which was beyond his control.
This may have been the influence of anything the shaman may at the
moment think of, such as a sudden appearance in the changing auroras,
a&nbsp;fall of snow, or a dog knocking down something outside of the
house. If the people deny that the dog did the act, the shaman replies
that the dog was the instrument in the hands of a spirit which escaped
him. Any little incident is sufficient to thwart the success of his
manipulations. If any person be the subject of the shaman’s displeasure
he or she must undergo some sort of punishment or do an act of penance
for the interference. It is not unusual to see a person with the harness
of a dog on his back. This is worn to relieve him or somebody else of a
spell of the evil spirit. The tail of a living dog is often cut from its
body in order that the fresh blood may be cast upon the ground to be
seen by the spirit who has caused the harm, and thus he may be appeased.
Numerous mutilations are inflicted upon animals at the command of the
conjurer, who must be consulted on nearly all the important undertakings
of life in order that he may manage the spirits which will insure
success.</p>

<p>The implicit belief in these personages is wonderful. Almost every
person who can do anything not fully understood by others has more or
less reputation as a shaman.</p>

<p>Some men, by observation, become skilled in weather lore, and get a
great reputation for supernatural knowledge of the future weather.
Others again are famous for suggesting charms to insure success in
hunting, and, in fact, the occasions for consulting the conjurer are
practically innumerable. One special qualification of a good shaman is
the ability to attract large numbers of deer or other game into the
region where he and his friends are hunting.</p>

<p>Some of these shamans are superior hunters and, as their experience
teaches them the habits of the deer, they know at any season exactly
where the animals are and can anticipate their future movements,
influenced greatly by the weather. Thus the prophet is able to estimate
the proximity or remoteness of the various herds of stragglers from the
main body of deer which were in the locality during the preceding fall
months. These hunters have not only a local reputation but are known as
far as the people have any means of communication.</p>

<p>In order to cause the deer to move toward the locality where they may
be desired the shaman will erect, on a pole placed in a favorable
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page197" id =
"page197">197</a></span>
position, an image of some famous hunter and conjurer. The image will
represent the power of the person as conjurer and the various
paraphernalia attached to the image assist in controlling the movements
of the animals.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 22.</span> Magic doll.</p>

<p>I obtained one of these objects at Fort Chimo. (Fig. 22.) It is quite
elaborate and requires a detailed description. It is intended to
represent a celebrated conjurer living on the eastern shore of Hudson
bay. He occasionally visited Fort Chimo where his reputation as a hunter
had preceded him. His name is Sa´pa.</p>

<p>He is dressed in a complete suit of the woolen stuff called “strouds”
at Fort Chimo, trimmed with black and with fancy tartan gartering. In
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page198" id =
"page198">198</a></span>
the belt of polar-bear skin (kak-cung´-unt) (Fig.&nbsp;23) are hung
strings of colored beads and various amulets. These are, first,
a&nbsp;wooden doll (Fig.&nbsp;24) (ĭnug´-wak, a&nbsp;little man) hung to
the belt so that he faces outward and is always on the alert; then, two
bits of wood (agówak) (Fig.&nbsp;25) to which hang strands of beads and
lead drops; next, a&nbsp;string of three bullets (Fig.&nbsp;26) to
symbolize the readiness of the hunter when game approaches; and, last,
a&nbsp;semicircular piece of wood ornamented with strings of beads
(Fig.&nbsp;27).</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 23.</span> Belt of magic doll.</p>

<p>This last is called the tu-a´-vi-tok, or hastener. The hunter holds
it in his hand when he sights the game, and the tighter he grasps it the
faster he is supposed to get over the ground. It is supposed that by the
use of this one may be able to travel faster than the wind and not even
touch the earth over which he passes with such incredible speed that he
overtakes the deer in a moment. The entire affair, as it hung on the
pole, was called tung wa´gn e´nog ang´, or a materialization of a
Tung&nbsp;ak.</p>

<p>This object hung there for several days until I thought it had served
its purpose and could now afford to change ownership. The local conjurer
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page199" id =
"page199">199</a></span>
was thus compelled to invoke the assistance of another. I&nbsp;am happy
to add that the deer did come, and in thousands, actually running among
the houses of the station.</p>

<p>The shaman of the community possesses great influence over its
members. He very frequently decides the course to be pursued by man and
wife in their relations with each other, and, conspiring with some evil
old woman who loves to show preference for a young man, he often decrees
that husband or wife shall be cast off.</p>

<p>If the person become ill the wife is often accused of working some
charm on her husband in order that she may enjoy the favors of another.
A&nbsp;woman whose husband had recently died was espoused by another who
soon after became violently ill. She nursed him with the greatest
assiduity until he convalesced. At this period his mother, with the
advice of some old hags, decreed that she had been the sole cause of her
husband’s illness and must leave the tent. Her things were pitched out
and she was compelled to journey in quest of her relatives.</p>

<p>Another illustration came under my notice.</p>

<p>A widow was taken to wife by a Koksoak Eskimo. He was soon taken
violently ill and she was accused by the shaman of being the cause of
it, as the spirit of her deceased husband was jealous. Unless she were
cast off the Koksoak man would never recover. It was then
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page200" id =
"page200">200</a></span>
also found that unless the wife of another man should desert him and
become the wife of a man who already had two of this woman’s sisters as
wives the sick man would die. The woman and her husband escaped divorce
by fleeing from the camp.</p>

<p>The shaman may do about as he pleases with the marriage ties, which
oftener consist of sealskin thongs than respect and love. Many old hags
have acquired great reputations for being able to interpret dreams. An
instance of dream interpretation, which also illustrates how a person
may acquire a new name, came under my observation. A&nbsp;woman, sitting
alone, heard a noise like the rapping of someone at the door desiring
admittance. She said, “Come in.” No one appeared, and she inquired of
the girl who acted as nurse for her child if anyone had knocked at the
door. A&nbsp;negative answer was given. Further questioning of a white
man, who was asleep near by, revealed that he had made no such sound.
The woman knew that no man had died within the place and so his spirit
could not be seeking admittance. She went to an old woman and related
the affair, and was informed that it was the rapping of her brother, who
had died suddenly some two years before. She must go home and prepare a
cup of tea, with a slice of bread, and give it to the nurse, as her
brother, Nakvak (the one who died) was hungry and wanted food. She
especially enjoined upon the woman that the girl must now be known as
Nakvak (meaning “found”) and that through her the dead would procure the
food which, although it subserves a good purpose in nourishing the
living, tends, by its accompanying spirit, to allay the pangs of hunger
in the dead.</p>

<p>As I have already said, everything in the world is believed to have
its attendant spirit. The spirits of the lower animals are like those of
men, but of an inferior order. As these spirits, of course, can not be
destroyed by killing the animals, the Eskimo believe that no amount of
slaughter can <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘realy’">really</ins> decrease the numbers of the game.</p>

<p>A great spirit controls the reindeer. He dwells in a huge cavern near
the end of Cape Chidley. He obtains and controls the spirit of every
deer which is slain or dies, and it depends on his good will whether the
people shall obtain future supplies. The form of the spirit is that of a
huge white bear. The shaman has the power to prevail upon the spirit to
send the deer to the people who are represented as suffering
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page201" id =
"page201">201</a></span>
for want of food. The spirit is informed that the people have in no way
offended him, as the shaman, as a mediator between the spirit and the
people, has taken great care that the past food was all eaten and that
last spring, when the female deer were returning to him to be delivered
of their young, none of the young (or&nbsp;fœtal) deer were devoured by
the dogs. After much incantation the shaman announces that the spirit
condescends to supply the people with spirits of the deer in a material
form and that soon an abundance will be in the land. He enjoins upon the
people to slay and thus obtain the approval of the spirit, which loves
to see good people enjoy an abundance, knowing that so long as the
people refrain from feeding their dogs with the unborn young, the
spirits of the deer will in time return again to his guardianship.</p>

<p>Certain parts of the first deer killed must be eaten raw, others
discarded, and others must be eaten cooked. The dogs must not be allowed
to taste of the flesh, and not until an abundance has been obtained must
they be allowed to gnaw at the leg bones, lest the guardian spirit of
the deer be offended and refuse to send further supplies. If by some
misfortune the dogs get at the meat, a&nbsp;piece of the offending dog’s
tail is cut off or his ear is cropped to allow a flow of blood.</p>

<p>Ceremonies of some kind attend the capture of the first slain animal
of all the more important kinds. I&nbsp;unfortunately had no opportunity
of witnessing many of these ceremonies.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of the superstitious beliefs that I have
described, the use of amulets is universal. Some charms are worn to ward
off the attacks of evil-disposed spirits. Other charms are worn as
remembrances of deceased relatives. These have the form of a headless
doll depending from some portion of the garment worn on the upper part
of the body.</p>

<p>As many of their personal names are derived from natural objects, it
is usual for the person to wear a little image of the object for which
he is named or a portion of it; for example, a&nbsp;wing of the bird, or
a bit of the animal’s skin. This is supposed to gratify the spirit of
the object. Strange or curious objects never before seen are sometimes
considered to bring success to the finder.</p>

<p>Two articles selected from my collection will illustrate different
forms of amulets. The first, No. 3018, is a little wooden model of a
kaiak. The other (3090, Fig.&nbsp;28) was worn on the back of a woman’s
coat. It is a small block of wood carved into four human heads. These
heads represent four famous conjurers noted for their skill in driving
away diseases. The woman, who came from the eastern shore of Hudson’s
bay, was troubled with rheumatism and wore this charm from time to time
as she felt the twinges of pain. She assured me that the pain
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page202" id =
"page202">202</a></span>
always disappeared in a few hours when she wore it. It was with the
greatest difficulty that I persuaded her to part with it. She was,
however, about to return home, and could get another there.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_outdoor" id = "kokso_outdoor">
OUTDOOR LIFE.</a></h5>

<p>The Eskimo acquire an extended knowledge of the country by early
accompanying their parents on hunting trips, and as they have to rely
upon memory alone, they must be observant and carefully mark the
surroundings from all the views afforded. The faculty of memory is thus
cultivated to an astonishing degree, and seldom fails, even in the most
severe weather, to insure safety for the individual. I&nbsp;knew a
native stick his ramrod in the ground among scattered stalks of grass
which attained the height of the rod, yet after several hours he found
the spot again without the least hesitation. Every rise of land, every
curve of a stream, every cove in the seashore, has a name descriptive of
something connected with it, and these names are known to all who have
occasion to visit the place. Though the aspect of the land is entirely
changed by the mantle of snow which covers all the smaller objects,
a&nbsp;hunter will go straight to the place where the carcass of a
single deer was cached many months before on the open beach. The Eskimo
are faithful guides, and when confidence is shown to be reposed in them
they take a pride in leading the party by the best route. In traveling
by night they use the north star for the guide. Experience teaches them
to foretell the weather, and some reliance may be placed on their
predictions.</p>

<p>Their knowledge of the seasons is also wonderful. The year begins
when the sun has reached its lowest point, that is, at the winter
solstice, and summer begins with the summer solstice. They recognize the
arrival of the solstices by the bearing of the sun with reference to
certain fixed landmarks.</p>

<p>The seasons have distinctive names, and these are again subdivided
into a great number, of which there are more during the warmer weather
than during the winter. The reason for this is obvious: so many changes
are going on during the summer and so few during the winter. The
principal events are the return of the sun, always a signal of joy to
the people; the lengthening of the day; the warm weather in March when
the sun has attained sufficient height to make his rays less slanting
and thus be more fervent; the melting of the snow; the breaking up of
the ice; the open water; the time of birth of various seals; the advent
of exotic birds; the nesting of gulls, eiders, and other native birds;
the arrival of white whales and the whaling season; salmon fishing; the
ripening of salmonberries and other species of edibles; the time of
reindeer crossing the river; the trapping of fur-bearing animals and
hunting on land and water for food. Each of these periods has a special
name applied to it, although several may overlap each other. The
appearance of mosquitoes, sand-flies,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page203" id =
"page203">203</a></span>
and horseflies are marked by dates anticipated with considerable
apprehension of annoyance.</p>

<p>In order to sketch the annual routine of life, I will begin with the
breaking up of the ice in spring. The Koksoak river breaks its ice about
the last of May. This period, however, may vary as much as ten days
earlier and twenty days later than the date specified. The ice in Ungava
bay, into which that river flows, must be free from the greater portion
of the shore ice before the river ice can push its way out to sea. The
winds alone influence the bay ice, and the character of the weather
toward the head waters of the river determines its time of breaking.</p>

<p>The Eskimo has naturally a keen perception of the signs in the sky
and is often able to predict with certainty the effects of the preceding
weather. When the season has sufficiently advanced all the belongings of
each family are put together and transported down the river on sleds to
where the ice has not yet gone from the mouth of the river. It is very
seldom that the river ice extends down so far. To the edge of the ice
the tent and dogs, with the umiak, kaiak, and other personal property,
are taken and then stored on shore until the outside ice is free.</p>

<p>The men wander along the beach or inland hunting for reindeer,
ptarmigan, hares, and other land game. The edge of the water is searched
for waterfowl of various kinds which appear earliest. Some venturesome
seals appear. In the course of a few days the ice in the river breaks up
and the shore ice of the bay is free; and if there is a favorable wind
it soon permits the umiak to be put into the water, where, by easy
stages, depending on the weather, the quantity of floating ice, and the
food supply, the hunters creep alongshore to the objective point, be it
either east or west of the Koksoak. Sometimes the party divide, some
going in one direction and others in another.</p>

<p>The men seek for seals, hunting in the kaiak, the women and children
searching the islets and coves for anything edible. As soon as the
season arrives for the various gulls, eiders, and other sea birds to
nest the women and children are in high glee. Every spot is carefully
examined, and every accessible nest of a bird is robbed of its contents.
By the 25th of June the people have exhausted the supply of eggs from
the last situations visited and now think of returning, as the birds
have again deposited eggs and the seals are becoming scarcer.</p>

<p>The Eskimo arrange to assist the company to drive white whales when
the season arrives. This is as soon as they appear in the river at a
sufficient distance up to warrant that the measures pursued will not
drive them out of the fresh water, for if they left they would not soon
return. The date usually fixed upon is about the 12th of July. The
natives are summoned, and a large sailboat or the small steam launch is
sent along the coast to the place where the people were expected to
arrive the 5th of the month. The natives are brought to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page204" id =
"page204">204</a></span>
whaling station, where they encamp, to await the setting of the nets
forming the sides of the inclosure into which the whales are to be
driven.</p>

<p>The natives spear the whales in the pound, drag them ashore, skin
them, and help take the oil and skins to the post, some eight miles
farther up the river.</p>

<p>The same natives who engaged in the whaling are employed to attend
the nets for salmon, which arrive at variable dates from the 25th of
July to the 1st of September. Two or more adult male Eskimo, with their
relatives, occupy a certain locality, generally known by the name of the
person in charge of that season’s work. The place is occupied until the
runs of the fish are over, when it is time for the natives to be up the
river to spear reindeer which cross the river.</p>

<p>This hunting lasts until the deer have begun to rut and the males
have lost the fat from the small of the back. The season is now so far
advanced that the ice is already forming along the shore, and unless the
hunter intends to remain in that locality he would better begin to
descend the river to a place nearer the sea. The river may freeze in a
single night and the umiak be unable to withstand the constant strain of
the sharp-edged cakes of floating ice.</p>

<p>The head of the family decides where the winter is to be passed and
moves thither with his party at once. Here he has a few weeks of rest
from the season’s labors, or spends the time constructing a sled for the
winter journeys he may have in view. The snow has now fallen so that a
snow house may be constructed and winter quarters taken up.
A&nbsp;number of steel traps are procured to be set for foxes and other
fur-bearing animals. The ptarmigans arrive in large flocks and are
eagerly hunted for their flesh and feathers. The birds are either
consumed for food or sold to the company, which pays 6¼ cents for four,
and purchases the body feathers of the birds at the rate of 4 pounds of
the feathers for 25 cents.</p>

<p>The Eskimo soon consume the amount of deer meat they brought with
them on their return and subsist on the flesh of the ptarmigan until the
ice is firm enough to allow the sleds to be used to transport to the
present camp meat of animals slain in the fall.</p>

<p>The traps are visited and the furs are sold to the company in
exchange for flour, tea, sugar, molasses, biscuit, clothing, and
ammunition. Hunting excursions are made to various localities for stray
bands of deer that have become separated from the larger herds.</p>

<p>The white men employés of the company have been engaged in cutting
wood for the next year’s fuel, and the Eskimo with their dog teams are
hired to haul it to the bank, where it may be floated down in rafts when
the river opens.</p>

<p>Thus passes the year in the life of the Eskimo of the immediate
vicinity of Fort Chimo. Some of the Koksoagmyut do not engage in these
occupations. Some go to another locality to live by themselves; others
do not work or hunt, because it is not their nature to do so.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page205" id =
"page205">205</a></span>
<p>In all undertakings for themselves they deliberate long, with much
hesitation and apparent reluctance, before they decide upon the line of
action. They consult each other and weigh the advantages of this over
that locality for game, and speculate on whether they will be afflicted
with illness of themselves or family. When the resolution is finally
made to journey to a certain place, only the most serious obstacles can
thwart their purpose.</p>

<p>At all seasons of the year the women have their allotted duties,
which they perform without hesitation. They bring the wood and the
water, and the food from the field, if it is not too distant, in which
case the men go after it with the dog teams. The women also fashion the
skins into clothing and other articles, and do the cooking. After a hunt
of several days’ duration the husband’s appearance is anxiously awaited,
as is indicated by the family scanning the direction whence he is
expected. The load is taken from the sled or boat and the incidents of
the chase recited to the ever ready listeners.</p>

<p>In the early spring the women are busily engaged in making boots for
summer wear. The skins of the seals have been prepared the fall before
and stored away until wanted. The method of tanning the skins is the
same for each species, differing only in its size and weight.</p>

<p>Certain large vessels made of wood or metal, chiefly the latter, as
they are easily procured from the traders, are used to hold a liquid,
which is from time to time added to. When a sufficient amount is
collected it is allowed to ferment. During the interval the skin of the
seal is cleansed from fat and flesh. The hair has been removed by
shaving it off or by pulling it out. The skin is then dressed with an
instrument designed for that purpose, made of ivory, deerhorn, stone, or
even a piece of tin set in the end of a stout stick several inches long.
The skin is held in the hand and the chisel-shaped implement is
repeatedly pushed from the person and against a portion of the skin
until that part becomes pliable and soft enough to work. It is further
softened by rubbing between the hands with a motion similar to that of
the washerwoman rubbing clothing of the wash. Any portion of the skin
which will not readily yield to this manipulation is chewed with the
front teeth until it is reduced to the required pliability. After this
operation has been completed the skin is soaked in the liquid, which has
now ripened to a sufficient degree to be effective. In this it is laid
for a period lasting from several hours to two or three days. The skin
is now taken out and dried. The subsequent operation of softening is
similar to that just described, and is final. It is now ready to be cut
into the required shape for the various articles for which it is
intended. If it is designed for boots for a man, the measure of the
height of the leg is taken. The length and width of the sole is measured
by the hand, stretching so far and then bending down the long or middle
finger until the length is measured. The width of one, two, or more
fingers is sometimes used in addition to the span. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page206" id =
"page206">206</a></span>
length is thus marked and the skin folded over so as to have it doubled.
The knife used in cutting is shaped like the round knife used by the
harness-maker or shoemaker.</p>

<p>There is in our collection a wooden model of this form of knife
(No.&nbsp;3022), which nowadays always has a blade of metal. Formerly
slate, flint, or ivory was used for these blades.</p>

<p>The instrument is always pushed by the person using it. The eye alone
guides the knife, except on work for a white man, and then greater care
is exercised and marks employed indicating the required size. This round
knife is called úlo.</p>

<p>Another important duty of the women is taking care of the family
boots. When a pair of boots has been worn for some time, during a few
hours in warm weather they absorb moisture and become nearly half an
inch thick on the soles. When taken off they must be turned inside out
and dried, then chewed and scraped by some old woman, who is only too
glad to have the work for the two or three biscuit she may receive as
pay. Any leak or hole is stitched, and when the sole has holes worn
through it, it is patched by sewing a piece on the under side. The
thread used in sewing the boots is selected from the best strips of
sinew from the reindeer or seal.</p>

<p>Some women excel in boot-making, and at some seasons do nothing but
make boots, while the others in return prepare the other garments. When
the time comes in spring for making sealskin clothes, the women must not
sew on any piece of deerskin which has not yet been sewed, lest the
seals take offense and desert the locality which has been selected for
the spring seal hunt, to which all the people look forward with longing,
that they may obtain a supply of food different from that which they
have had during the long winter months. As there can be no harm in
killing a deer at this season, the flesh may be used, but the skin must
be cast away.</p>

<p>As before stated, the entire family accompany the expeditions; and as
the females are often the more numerous portion of the population, they
row the umiak at their leisure, now and then stopping to have a few
hours’ run on shore and again embarking. While thus journeying they are
at times a sleepy crowd, until something ahead attracts attention; then
all become animated, pursuing the object, if it be a half-fledged bird,
until it is captured. Great amusement is thus afforded for the time,
after which they relapse until some excitement again arouses them from
their apparent lethargy. At the camp the men go in quest of larger game,
leaving the women and children, who search the shore for any living
creature they may find, destroying all that comes in their way. Smoking,
eating, and sleeping occupy them until they arrive at a locality where
food is abundant. There they earnestly strive to slay all that comes
within reach, and thus often obtain much more than they require, and the
remainder is left to putrefy on the rocks. The women do the skinning of
the seals and birds obtained on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page207" id =
"page207">207</a></span>
this trip. The skins of birds are removed in a peculiar manner. The
wings are cut off at the body, and through the incision all the flesh
and bones are taken out. The skin is then turned inside out. The grease
is removed by scraping and chewing. The skin is dried and preserved for
wear on the feet or for the purpose of cleansing the hands, which have
become soiled with blood or other offal in skinning large game.</p>

<p>When the season arrives for hunting the reindeer for their skins,
with which to make clothing for winter, the women help to prepare the
flesh and bring the wood and water for the camp, while the men are ever
on the alert for the herds of deer on the land or crossing the water.
The women hang the skins over poles until the greater portion of the
animal matter is dry, when they roll them up and store them away until
the party is ready to return to the permanent camp for the winter. Here
the skins collected are carefully examined and suitable ones selected
for winter garments.</p>

<p>The skins are moistened with water and the adherent fleshy particles
are removed with a knife. They are then roughly scraped and again
wetted, this time with urine, which is supposed to render them more
pliable. The operation is practically the same as that of tanning
sealskins. The hair is, of course, left on the skin. When the skins are
finally dry and worked to the required pliability, they are cut into
shape for the various articles of apparel. The thread used in sewing is
simply a strip of sinew of the proper size. The fibers are separated by
splitting off a sufficient amount, and with the finger nail the strip is
freed from all knots or smaller strands which would prevent drawing
through the needle holes. The thread for this purpose is never twisted
or plaited. The needle is one procured from the trader. Small bone
needles, imitations of these, are sometimes used. In former years the
bone needle was the only means of carrying the thread, but this has now,
except in the rarest instances, been entirely superseded by one of
metal.</p>

<p>The thimble is simply a piece of stiff sealskin sewed into a ring
half an inch wide to slip on the first finger, and has the same name as
that member. In sewing of all kinds the needle is pointed toward the
operator. The knife used in cutting skins is the same as that previously
described. Scissors are not adapted to cutting a skin which retains the
fur. So far as my observations goes, scissors are used only for cutting
textile fabrics procured from the store.</p>

<p>In the use of a knife women acquire a <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘wonderous’ (word occurs elsewhere)">wondrous</ins>
dexterity, guiding it to the desired curve with much skill, or using the
heel of the blade to remove strips which may need trimming off.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_tattoo" id = "kokso_tattoo">
TATTOOING.</a></h5>

<p>In former years the women were fancifully tattooed with curved lines
and rows of dots on the face, neck, and arms, and on the legs up to
mid-thigh. This custom, however, fell into disuse because some
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page208" id =
"page208">208</a></span>
shaman declared that a prevailing misfortune was the result of the
tattooing. At present the tattooing is confined to a few single dots on
the body and face. When a girl arrives at puberty she is taken to a
secluded locality by some old woman versed in the art and stripped of
her clothing. A&nbsp;small quantity of half-charred lamp wick of moss is
mixed with oil from the lamp. A&nbsp;needle is used to prick the skin,
and the pasty substance is smeared over the wound. The blood mixes with
it, and in a day or two a dark-bluish spot alone is left. The operation
continues four days. When the girl returns to the tent it is known that
she has begun to menstruate. A&nbsp;menstruating woman must not wear the
lower garments she does at other times. The hind flap of her coat must
be turned up and stitched to the back of the garment. Her right hand
must be half-gloved, or, in other words, the first two joints of each
finger of that hand must be uncovered. The left hand also remains
uncovered. She must not touch certain skins and food which at that
particular season are in use.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_clothing" id = "kokso_clothing">
CLOTHING.</a></h5>

<p>Like most Eskimo, the Koksoagmyut are clothed almost entirely in the
skins of animals, though the men now wear breeches of moleskin, duck,
jeans, or denim procured from the trading store. Reindeerskin is the
favorite material for clothing, though skins of the different seals are
also used. The usual garments are a hooded frock, of different shapes
for the sexes, with breeches and boots. The latter are of various shapes
for different weather, and there are many patterns of mittens. Rain
frocks of seal entrail are also worn over the furs in stormy weather.
Some of the people are very tidy and keep their clothing in a
respectable condition. Others are careless and often present a most
filthy sight. The aged and orphans, unless the latter be adopted by some
well-to-do person, must often be content with the cast-off apparel of
their more fortunate fellow-beings.</p>

<p>The hair of the skins wears off in those places most liable to be in
contact with other objects. The elbows, wrists, and knees often are
without a vestige of hair on the clothing. The skin wears through and
then is patched with any kind of a piece, which often presents a
ludicrous appearance.</p>

<p>The young boys and girls are dressed alike, and the females do not
wear the garments of the adults until they arrive at puberty. It is a
ludicrous sight to witness some of the little ones scarcely able to walk
dressed in heavy deerskin clothing, which makes them appear as thick as
they are tall. They exhibit about the same amount of pride of their new
suits as the civilized boy does. They are now able to go out into the
severest weather, and seem to delight in rolling around in the snow.</p>

<p>Infants at the breast, so small as to be carried in the mother’s
hood, are often dressed in skins of the reindeer fawns. The garment
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page209" id =
"page209">209</a></span>
for these is a kind of “combination,” the trousers and body sewed
together and cut down the back to enable the infant to get them on.
A&nbsp;cap of calico or other cloth and a pair of skin stockings
completes the suit.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 29.</span> Eskimo birdskin cap.</p>
</div>

<p>Both men and women wear, as an additional protection for their feet
in cold weather, a&nbsp;pair or two of short stockings, locally known as
“duffles,” from the name of the material of which they are made. These
“duffles” are cut into the form of a slipper and incase the stockings of
the feet. Over these are worn the moccasins, made of tanned and smoked
deerskin. The Eskimo women are not adepts in making moccasins;
a&nbsp;few only can form a well-fitting pair. They often employ the
Indian women to make them, and, in return, give a pair of sealskin
boots, which the Indian is unable to make, but highly prizes for summer
wear in the swamps.</p>

<p>The Koksoagmyut do not wear caps, the hood of the frocks being the
only head covering. There is, however, in my collection a cap obtained
from one of the so-called “Northerners,” who came to Fort Chimo to
trade. This cap (No.&nbsp;3242, Fig.&nbsp;29) was evidently copied from
some white man’s cap. The front and crown of the cap are made of
guillemot and sea-pigeon skins, and the sealskin neckpiece also is lined
with these skins, so that when it is turned up the whole cap seems to be
made of bird skins.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to the description of the different garments in
detail.</p>

<p>The coat worn by the men and boys, and by the girls until they arrive
at womanhood, has the form of a loose shirt, seldom reaching more than 2
or 3 inches below the hips, and often barely covering the hips. The neck
hole is large enough to admit the head into the hood, which may be
thrown back or worn over the head in place of a cap.</p>

<p>The Innuit of the southern shore of the western end of Hudson Strait
often cut the coat open in front as far up as the breast (Figs. 30 and
31, No. 3224). The favorite material for these coats is the skin of the
reindeer, three good-sized skins being required to make a full-sized
coat for a man. Coats made of light summer skins are used as
underclothing in winter and for the only body clothing in summer. The
skin of the harp seal (<i>Phoca grœnlandica</i>) is also used for coats,
but only when the supply of reindeerskin runs short, or when a man can
afford to have an extra coat to wear in wet weather. It is not a very
good
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page210" id =
"page210">210</a></span>
material for clothing, as the skin is roughly tanned, and no amount of
working will render it more than moderately pliable. Figs. 32 and 33
represent a sealskin coat. These coats are often trimmed round the edges
with fringes of deerskin 2 or 3 inches wide, or little pendants of
ivory.</p>

and 3558 of deerskin, and Nos. 3228, 3533-3537 of sealskin.</p>

<p>The peculiar shape of the woman’s coat is best understood by
reference to the accompanying figures (Figs. 34, 35, 36, 37
and&nbsp;38). The enormous hood is used for carrying the infant. When
sitting, the female usually disposes the front flap so that it will lie
spread upon the thighs, or else pushes it between her legs, while the
hind flap is either thrown aside or sat upon.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the women to display considerable taste in
ornamenting their garments, using the steel-gray pelt of the harp seal
to contrast with the black of the harbor seal, and so on. The edges of
the hood and sleeves are frequently trimmed with skin from a dark
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page211" id =
"page211">211</a></span>
colored young dog; or a strip of polar bear skin, whose long white hairs
shed the rain better than those of any other mammal.</p>

<p>It is not rare to find loops of sinew or of sealskin attached to the
breast or back of a woman’s garments. These are for tying small
articles, such as a needle case or a snuff-bag, to the clothing for
convenience and to prevent loss.</p>

<p>A peculiar style of ornamentation is shown in Fig. 39 and 40, No.
3005, a&nbsp;woman’s coat from Fort Chimo. The front of the skirt is
fringed with little lead drops, bean-shaped in the upper row and
pear-shaped in the lower, and pierced so that they can be sewed on.
These lead drops are furnished by the trader at the price of about a
cent and a half each, in trade. The trimming of this frock cost,
therefore, about $4. The four objects dangling from the front of the
frock are pewter spoon-bowls. Across the breast is a fringe of short
strings of different colored beads, red, black, yellow, white, and blue.
Jingling ornaments are much prized.</p>

<p>The tin tags from plug tobacco are eagerly sought for, perforated and
attached in pendant strands 3 or 4 inches long to sealskin strips and
thus serve the place of beads. I&nbsp;saw one woman who certainly had
not less than a thousand of these tags jingling as she walked.
I&nbsp;have also seen coins of various countries attached to the arms
and dress. One coin was Brazilian, another Spanish, and several were
English. Coins of the provinces were quite numerous. These were all
doubtless obtained from the sailors who annually visit the place, in
exchange for little trinkets prepared by the men and women.</p>

<p>The collection contains five of these coats, Nos. 3005, 3225-3227 of
deerskin, and 3504 of sealskin. The last is a very elaborate garment,
made of handsomely contrasted pieces of the skin of two kinds of seals,
the harbor seal and the harp seal, arranged in a neat pattern.</p>

<p>It is not common to come across a garment of this kind, as the skins
of the proper or desired kinds are sometimes hard to obtain.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page213" id =
"page213">213</a></span>
The woman may be several years in getting the right kind and may have
effected many exchanges before being suited with the quality and color.
The darkest skins of the Ka sig yak (harbor seal) are highly prized by
both sexes. The women set the higher value upon them. The men wear two
styles of leg covering, namely, breeches like a white man’s, but not
open in front, and reaching but a short distance below the knees, or
trousers ending in stocking feet. Sometimes in very cold weather these
trousers may be worn under the breeches. Both breeches and trousers are
very short-waisted. Long stockings of short-haired deerskin with the
hair in are also worn. The women in winter wear breeches made of
deerskin fastened around the hips by means of a drawstring and extending
down the legs to where the tops of the boots will cover them a few
inches. Some of the women wear trousers which reach only to the upper
part of the thighs and are continuous with the boot which covers the
foot, though in that case a pair of half-boots are added to protect the
feet. The hips are covered with breeches which descend low enough on the
thigh to be covered by the leggings. This style of apparel for the lower
portion of the body is often extravagantly patched with various colored
pieces of white and dark strips of skin from the abdomen and sides of
the reindeer. When new and not soiled they are quite attractive and
often contrast well with the tastefully ornamented coat.</p>

<p>The long boots or leggings are removed when dirty work is to be done.
Thus, skins to be scraped and dressed are held against the bare leg.</p>

<p>The leggings also serve as pockets to hold various kinds of little
things, like knives, tobacco, and so on.</p>

<p>A person rarely owns more than a single pair of breeches;
consequently I was unable to obtain any for the collection.</p>

<p>The boots and shoes are of different materials and somewhat different
patterns for different seasons of the year. All have moccasin
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page214" id =
"page214">214</a></span>
soles of stout material turned up an inch or two all round the foot,
a&nbsp;tongue covering the top of the foot, joined to a broad heel band
which passes round behind the ankle. Then the legs are either made long
enough to reach to the knee or else almost to the ankle. These
half-boots are worn over the fur stockings in warm weather, or outside
the long boots in very severe weather. Indian moccasins are also worn,
sometimes over a pair of inside shoes and sometimes as inside shoes.</p>

<p>For thick waterproof soles the skin of the beaver or the harp seal is
used. The former wears the better. White whale skin is also used
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page215" id =
"page215">215</a></span>
for indoor shoes, or for shoes to be worn in cold dry weather; the skins
of the smaller seals are used, sometimes with the flesh side out and the
hair in, sometimes with the grain side out. These thinner skins are
comparatively waterproof if the black epidermis is allowed to remain on.
The beautiful creamy-white leather, made by allowing the skin to ferment
until hair and epidermis are scraped off together and then stretching
the skin and exposing it to dry cold air, does not resist water at all,
and can only be used for soles in perfectly dry weather.</p>

<p>Buckskin soles are also used to enable the wearer to walk better with
snowshoes on, as the feet are not so liable to slip or clog with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page216" id =
"page216">216</a></span>
snow as they would be if the footing were of sealskin. This latter has
also another serious disadvantage. If it is very cold it does not permit
the moisture from the feet to pass out as it freezes, rendering the boot
stiff and slippery on the snowshoe, while the buckskin is porous and
readily allows the moisture to escape.</p>

<p>The tongue and heel band are generally made of tanned sealskin,
contrasting colors being often used. The legs are of sealskin, with the
hair on, or of reindeer skin.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 42.</span> Eskimo shoes.</p>

<p>A peculiar style of shoe (Fig. 43), of which I collected four pairs,
is used by the so-called “Northerners,” who derive most of their
subsistence from the sea in winter, and who constantly have to travel on
the ice, which is often very slippery. To prevent slipping, narrow
strips of sealskin are sewed upon a piece of leather, which makes an
undersole for the shoe, in the manner shown in the figure.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 43.</span> Ice-shoes, Hudson strait
Eskimo.</p>

<p>One end of the strip is first sewed to the subsole and the strip
pushed up into a loop and stitched again, and so on till a piece is made
big enough to cover the sole of the shoe, to which it is sewed. These
ice shoes are worn over the ordinary waterproof boots.</p>

<p>As I have already said, these boots are all made by the women. The
sole is cut out by eye and is broadly elliptical in shape, somewhat
pointed at the toe and heel. The leg is formed of a single piece, so
that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page218" id =
"page218">218</a></span>
there is but one seam; the tongue or piece to cover the instep may or
may not be a separate piece. If it is, the leg seam comes in front; if
it forms one piece with the leg piece, the seam is behind. When the leg
is sewed up and the tongue properly inserted the sole is sewed on. It is
tacked at the heel, toe, and once on opposite sides of the foot, to the
upper. The sewing of the sole to the upper is generally begun at the
side of the seam and continued around. Perpendicular creases at the
heel, and more numerously around the toes, take up the slack of the sole
and are carefully worked in. The making of this part of the shoe is most
difficult, for unless it is well sewed it is liable to admit water. The
creases or “gathers” are stitched through and through with a stout
thread, which holds them in place while the operation proceeds, and
which besides has a tendency to prevent the gathers from breaking down.
The heel, which comes well up the back of the boot, is stiffened by
means of several threads sewed perpendicularly, and as they are drawn
shorter than the skin, they prevent the heel from falling and thus
getting “run down.”</p>

<p>The seams of the boots, which are turned inside out during the
operation, are so arranged on the edges that one will overlap and be
tacked with close stitches over the rest of the seam. This is done not
only for comfort when the boot becomes dry and hard while being worn,
but also to take the strain from the stitches which hold the edges
together. The value of a pair of boots depends much on the care bestowed
in tanning and in sewing.</p>

<p>The hands are protected by mittens of different materials. Fur or
hair mittens are worn only in dry weather, as the hair would retain too
much moisture.</p>

<p>Among the Innuit the mammals are divided into two classes: the noble
and the inferior beasts. The skins of the former are used, though not
exclusively, by the men, while the latter may be worn only by the women.
No man would debase himself by wearing a particle of the fur of the hare
or of the white fox; the skins of these timid creatures are reserved for
the women alone. Either sex may wear the skins of all other mammals,
except at certain times, under restrictions imposed by superstition.</p>

<p>The women wear mittens of hare or fox skin, with palms of sealskin or
Indian-tanned bird’s skin. Reindeer skin with the hair on is also used
for mittens. The heavy skin from the body is selected for the sake of
warmth. When these mittens are to be used when driving dogs the palm is
made of sealskin, to enable the wearer to get a firm grasp on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page219" id =
"page219">219</a></span>
the whip handle. The skin of the deer’s forelegs, which has hair of a
different character from that on the body, also makes excellent mittens,
specially suited for handling snow in building the snow huts. Mittens
are sometimes fringed round the wrist with a strip of white bearskin to
keep out the wind.</p>

<p>All mittens have such short thumbs that they are very inconvenient
for a white man, who habitually holds his thumb spread away from the
palm, whereas the Innuit usually keep the thumb apposed to the palm. The
wrists of the mitten also are so short that considerable of the wrist is
often exposed. The sleeves of the jacket are generally fringed with wolf
or dog skin to protect this exposed portion of the wrist.</p>

<p>Similar mittens of black sealskin are also worn by the men during
damp weather, or when handling objects which would easily soil a pair of
furred mittens. I&nbsp;have never seen a woman wear this kind of
covering for the hand. It appears to be exclusively worn by the men.</p>

mitten.</p>
</div>

<p>The men who engage in the late fall seal hunting protect their hands
with waterproof gauntlets, which reach well up over the forearm. These
keep the hands from being wet by the spray and by the drip
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page220" id =
"page220">220</a></span>
from the paddle. Fig. 44, No. 90074, represents one of these long
mittens, made of black tanned sealskin, and edged with a strip of hairy
sealskin over an inch wide. The back or upper portion of the mitten is
made of a single piece of black skin, the edge of which is crimped and
turned under to protect the fingers. The palm is a separate piece,
joined to the backpiece, and on it is a projecting part to form the
inner half of the thumb. The outer half of the thumb and the under side
of the forearm are made of a single piece, stitched to the palm portion
and that which covers the back of the hand and arm, so that, including
the edging of hairy skin, there are only four pieces of skin entering
into the make of a pair of these mittens. They are worn only by the men,
and only when they are engaged in work where the hands would be immersed
in water during cold weather. As the skin from which they are made is
the same as that used for water-tight boots, it is obvious that no
moisture can touch the skin of the hand.</p>

<p>For protection from rain and wet they wear over their other clothes a
waterproof hooded frock (Fig.&nbsp;45) made of seal entrails, preferably
the intestines of the bearded seal (<i>Erignathus barbatus</i>). The
intestines of animals killed in October are considered the best for this
purpose. They then are not so fat and require less dressing to clean
them. The contents are removed and they are filled with water and
thoroughly washed out. The fat and other fleshy matter adhering are
removed by means of a knife used as a scraper. This being done, the
intestine is inflated with air and strung along the tops of the rocks to
dry. When dry it is carefully flattened and rolled into tight bundles,
like a spool of ribbon, and laid away until wanted.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 45.</span> Waterproof gutfrock.</p>

<p>When required for use it is split longitudinally, and when spread
open is of variable width from 3 to 5 inches, depending on the size of
the animal. The edges of the strips are examined and any uneven portions
are cut off, making the strip of uniform width. There are three separate
pieces in a garment&mdash;the body and hood as one and the sleeves as
two. Sometimes the sleeves are made first and sometimes the body is
sewed first, and of this latter portion the hood is first formed. Strips
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page221" id =
"page221">221</a></span>
are sewed edge to edge with the exterior of the intestine to form the
outside of the garment. The edge is turned down, so as to leave a width
of a third of an inch, and turned to the right; the other strip is
similarly folded, but turned to the left and laid on the other strip.
Sinew from the back of a reindeer or from a seal is made into threads a
yard or more in length and of the thickness of medium-sized wrapping
cord. The needle is usually of a number 3 or 4 in size or of less
diameter than the thread in order that the thread shall the more
effectually fill up the hole made by the needle. The two strips are then
sewed with stitches about nine to the inch, through and through, in a
manner, I&nbsp;believe, termed running stitches. When a sufficient
length is obtained a third strip is added, and so on until the required
number of perpendicular strips form a sufficient width to surround the
body. The outer edges are then joined and the body of the garment is
complete. Portions are cut out and the hood assumes the desired shape,
resembling a nightcap attached to the body of a nightgown. The sleeves
are sewed in a similar manner and affixed to the body of the garment.
The seams run perpendicularly and not around the body in a spiral manner
as in garments made by the natives of Alaska for similar purposes. The
edge of the hood, the wrists, and the bottom of the garment are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page222" id =
"page222">222</a></span>
strengthened by means of thin strips of sealskin sewed on the outside of
those parts where they are most liable to be torn. The garment is worn
during wet weather or while in the kaiak traveling on a rough sea. The
bottom of the garment is tied around the hoop of the kaiak in which the
wearer sits and thus effectually sheds the water from the body, except
the face, and keeps it from entering the kaiak.</p>

<p>Sometimes a drawstring closes the hood tightly around the face and
prevents the spray from entering. The string is usually tied at the top
of the hood, in which case it is rather difficult to untie.</p>

<p>When not in use the material must be well oiled and rolled up or it
will become so stiff that it can not be worn until it has been relaxed
by dipping in water. The sinew with which it is sewed swells when wet
and tightens the seams.</p>

<p>There is great difference in the length of the garments worn by the
eastern and the western Eskimo as well as in the manner of arranging the
strips of which they are made. The one worn by the people of Hudson
strait scarcely reaches to the hips of the wearer and is long enough
only to tie around the hoop of the kaiak. The ones worn by the Eskimo of
Northern sound, Alaska, falls to the knees, and those made by the Aleuts
are so long that they interfere with the feet in walking. The material
prepared by the eastern natives is not so good, as it is coarser and
stiffer than that of the sea lion (<i>Eumatopias stelleri</i>), used by
the natives of Alaska.</p>

<p>The weight of one of these garments when dry scarcely exceeds 6 or 7
ounces.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 46.</span> Snow goggles&mdash;front.</p>

<p>To protect the eyes from the glare of the snow, which is especially
trying when the sun is still low in early spring, snow goggles are worn
made to admit the light only through a narrow slit. (Figs. 46,
and&nbsp;47.) Nos. 3186, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3193, 3197,
3198, 3199, 3200, and 3201 in the collection show such snow goggles made
of wood. A&nbsp;somewhat curved piece of wood is fashioned to fit the
face over the eyes; a&nbsp;notch is fitted for the nose to rest in. The
lower side
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page223" id =
"page223">223</a></span>
is about half an inch thick, forming a flat surface. The front is
perpendicular and blackened with soot or gunpowder mixed with oil and
applied to darken the front surface to absorb the light of the sun’s
rays. Above this is a ledge of half an inch projecting over the narrow
longitudinal slit through which the wearer may look. This projection is
sometimes not blackened on the underside, and where wood is scarce it is
left off altogether. Within, on the side next to the eyes, it is usually
gouged out to allow the eyelashes free movement. A&nbsp;piece of
sealskin is affixed at each end and either tied in a knot over the head
to hold the wood in position, or else a wider strip of skin is slit and
one portion worn on the top of the head while the other fits the back of
the head to prevent the goggles from falling off when the wearer stoops
down.</p>

DWELLINGS.</a></h5>

<p>The winter dwellings of the Eskimo of Hudson strait consist of the
usual form of snow house. In this connection I may as well state that
the popular impression that the snow house described by Arctic travelers
is the only thing to be called an iglu is quite erroneous. The word
“iglu” is as fully generic in the Eskimo language as the word “house” is
in the English language. The correct term, as applied by the Eskimo, to
the snow house used as a dwelling is “ig&nbsp;lú ge&nbsp;ak”
(Fig.&nbsp;48.)</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 48.</span> Deserted Eskimo snow houses,
near Fort Chimo.</p>

<p>The first requisite for a snow house is snow. It must be of
sufficient depth and possess certain well-defined qualities. The snow
may fall, but until it has acquired sufficient depth for the size of
blocks required and firmness enough for strength to withstand the
superposed weight of the structure it is useless. An instrument termed
snowknife (pŭnŭk), shaped like a short sword, is used for the purpose of
cutting the blocks. The Eskimo seeks a place where the insertion of the
knife into the bed of snow will prove that the snow is in the proper
condition. He must
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page224" id =
"page224">224</a></span>
then cut out a block of a size convenient to be lifted. This is usually
rejected as it may be irregular or broken. Additional blocks, in size
from 8 to 10 inches thick, 2&nbsp;feet wide, and slightly more in length
are cut by a motion much resembling the act of sawing, cutting the depth
of the blade. The knife then cuts the bottom off squarely and the block
is lifted out, the builder standing where the first blocks were cut
from. The blocks are arranged on the bank of snow around the pit in
which the man stands. The first block usually is somewhat triangular in
shape for a purpose hereafter mentioned. The second block is cut out and
placed near the first, the end clipped with the knife to allow the first
joint to be close together. A&nbsp;third block is cut and placed by the
end of the second. It will now be seen that the line of blocks is not
straight, but curved concavely within. Additional blocks are cut and
placed end to end with each other until the first one laid is reached.
Here a longer block is cut to lay upon the inclined side of the
triangular-shaped block first used and so placed as to “break” the
joints, and thus render the structure more stable. Additional blocks are
placed on the first row, and as the operation proceeds it will be seen
that the blocks lie in a spiral form, gradually drawing in as the
structure rises, forming a dome-shaped wall of snow. The key block at
the top is carefully cut to fit the aperture and inserted from the
outside by the assistance of another person. All the joints are
carefully stopped up with spawls of snow or with snow crushed between
the hands and forced within the crevices.</p>

<p>The floor of the snow house is the bed of snow from which the
building
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page225" id =
"page225">225</a></span>
material was taken. The door is cut by taking blocks of snow from under
the bottom row of the foundation blocks. A&nbsp;trench is made, and
along the side of it the blocks are placed. An arched covering of the
material forms a sheltered passageway to the door.</p>

<p>When the snow house is to be occupied for a considerable time the
doorway may have walls of snow blocks piled as high as the shoulders,
with the top left open. This shields the entrance from wind and drifting
snow. Various forms of entrance are constructed, often very tortuous;
and when made a refuge by the numerous dogs they are not pleasant paths
along which to creep on hands and knees, for a panic may seize some
cowardly canine and all the dogs struggle to get suddenly out into the
open air. Vicious animals often wait until a white man gets about half
way through the entry and then make a sudden assault on him.</p>

<p>The interior of the house is arranged according to the number of
persons inhabiting it.</p>

<p>A raised bed, on which to sit during the day and sleep during the
night, is formed either by leaving a part of the snow-bank or else by
bringing in blocks and arranging them as a solid mass. On this are
spread bows of spruce, or dry grass, if obtainable, otherwise fine twigs
of willow or alder, and over these heavy reindeer or bear skins are
thrown. On these bed-skins are laid other softer skins of reindeer, with
which to cover the person on retiring to sleep. A&nbsp;window is
sometimes set in the side of the structure toward the sun. This is
simply a piece of thick, clear ice, from a lake, set in the wall of the
dome. It admits light, although it is generally light enough during the
day within the snow-house unless the walls be built particularly thick,
but great thickness in certain situations becomes necessary lest the
winds and drifting snow wear away the sides of the structure, causing it
to admit the cold or tumble down. Around the outside of the hut is
sometimes built a protecting wall of snow blocks, two or three feet
high, to prevent the drifting snow from wearing away the side of the
dwelling. A&nbsp;storm of a single night’s duration is often sufficient
to destroy a house.</p>

<p>The interior walls, in severe weather, become coated with frost films
from the breath, etc., condensing and crystallizing on the inside of the
dome and often presenting by the lamplight a brilliant show of myriads
of reflecting surfaces scintillating with greater luster than skillfully
set gems.</p>

<p>If the roof is not carefully shaped it is liable to cave in from the
heat within softening the snow, especially in moderate weather, and then
the entire structure falls.</p>

<p>Where the owner of the house has considerable possessions which must
be protected from the dogs and the weather, a&nbsp;similar structure is
prepared alongside of the dwelling and often connected with it by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page226" id =
"page226">226</a></span>
means of a communicating passage-way. An exterior opening may be made
and closed with a block of snow. The larger articles, such as bags of
oil and bundles of skins, are put inside before the walls are up, if
intended to be stored for some time.</p>

<p>As I have slept in these snow-houses I can assert that, while very
uncomfortable, they afford a protection which can not be dispensed with.
When the doorway is open they soon become very cold, and when closed
upon several persons the heat becomes intolerable. Odors from the food
remain long after the remnants are disposed of, and where one has been
occupied for a long period the accumulation of refuse becomes so great
that a new structure is indispensable in order to get rid of it. All the
work of the different members of the family is performed within the
walls. The skins of animals are dressed and tanned there. The offal of
game and the hair from dressed skins mingle in one mass, which soon
putrefies and creates such a stench that only an Eskimo with most obtuse
sense of smell could inhabit the place.</p>

<p>When spring comes the huts begin to melt and in the course of a few
warm days fall down. If the weather is too inclement to permit a skin
tent to be occupied, the first hole in the wall may be patched with a
deerskin, but this will afford very limited protection from the cold of
nights, for, however warm the days, the nights will, until late in May,
be so cold that only the older individuals withstand the cold.</p>

<p>When the structure falls, melted by sun or rain, the miserable
occupants must erect temporary shelter of deerskin or cloth on the bare
rocky ridges. Those too poor to own a skin tent have often but a blanket
of deerskin, stretched over three or four poles, set to shelter them
from the chilly northerly winds usually prevailing at that season.</p>

<p>Here they must sojourn until the ice breaks from the shores of the
coves and bays, enabling the hunters to procure seals from the sea.
Along the shores one may often find camping sites of these poor
wanderers searching through the day for food and at night camping under
the lee of a wall of rock with little other covering than that worn
during the day and this often soaked with spray or rain.</p>

<p>Improvidence and indolence result in the most cruel privations toward
the end of winter. Many who are too weak and emaciated from lack of food
to pursue the chase to gain a living starve before reaching the sea and
are left to perish.</p>

<p>When the season is more advanced, and the weather warm enough, those
who are industrious and provident enough to be the possessors of
sealskin tents, move into them for the season.</p>

<p>The skin tent (Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXVII</span>) is
usually made of the skins of the largest square flipper seals, those too
heavy for any other purpose or not necessary for other uses.</p>

ESKIMO TENT.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page227" id =
"page227">227</a></span>
<p>The number of skins necessary to form a tent varies with the size
required. Generally as many as ten to fifteen are used, and such a tent
will accommodate a good sized family.</p>

<p>The hair is seldom removed from the skin, which is simply stretched
as it comes from the animal and freed from fat and fleshy particles. The
edges are trimmed and a sufficient number of skins are sewed together to
form a length for one side of the tent. The length of the individual
skins makes the height of the tent. A&nbsp;similar width is prepared for
the opposite side. The two pieces meet at the rear of the structure and
are there tied to the poles. A&nbsp;separate piece forms the door and
may be thrown one side when a person enters or goes out. The poles of
the tent are arranged as follows: Two pairs of poles are joined near the
ends with stout thongs and erected with the lower ends spread to the
proper width, forming the ends of the tent, on which the ridgepole is
laid. A&nbsp;single pole is now placed near each end of the ridgepole,
resting on the upright pairs, to prevent lateral motion. Two more such
braces are placed on each side and spread so as to give a somewhat
rounded end to the tent. Near the middle of the ridgepole is a pair of
shorter poles leaning against it to prevent the weight of the sides from
bending the ridgepole. It will be seen that eleven poles are necessary
to support a long tent, as the skins are very heavy. The skins and poles
can be transported when the umiak is able to carry them.</p>

<p>In case of continued rains the skins are placed so as nearly to meet
over the ridge and additional skins cover the space left between the
edges. When the tent is to be taken down the two widths are folded over,
each by itself, and then rolled into a compact bundle by beginning at
each end and folding toward the center, leaving sufficient space between
the rolls for a person to get his head and shoulders in. Two persons,
one for each roll, now assist the carrier, who kneels, bows his head,
and places the load on his head and shoulders. The two assist him to
rise and the heavy load is taken to the umiak and placed in the bottom
for ballast. The shorter poles are first laid in on the ribs of the boat
to keep the skins from the water should any seep through the seams. The
second bundle of tenting is laid on the first.</p>

<p>The tent of skins is the usual shelter during the season from the
first rain until a sufficient fall of snow occurs in the early winter
from which to construct an iglu gheak.</p>

<p>The interior of the skin tent is necessarily quite roomy on account
of the number of occupants. The farther end often has a stick of timber
laid across the floor, and behind this is the bedding for the owner, his
wives, and children. A&nbsp;man who is able to own a tent of this
character is also wealthy enough to have two or more wives. Along the
remainder of the sides within lie the other occupants, either in groups
or singly, depending on the degree of relationship existing between
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page228" id =
"page228">228</a></span>
them. Guests and others temporarily abiding with the host are assigned
any portion of the tent that the host may choose to select, usually, if
great honor is to be shown, the place lately occupied by himself. The
central portion is reserved for a fireplace for cooking and heating
purposes. In this structure is carried on all manner of work incidental
to the season. The tent is taken from place to place by means of the
umiak when the food supply of a locality is exhausted or another region
promises greater abundance.</p>

<p>All these summer occupations require a number of persons to
successfully prosecute them, hence the number dwelling in one tent is
not often detrimental, as the adults walk along the shore to drag the
boat or relieve it from their weight.</p>

<p>The owner of a tent is considered an important individual, and his
favor is retained by every means. A&nbsp;period of illness may cause him
to lose all his belongings and then on recovery he has to start life
anew. Several seasons may elapse before a sufficient number of skins
will be procured for him to make a tent, and this is immovable without a
boat to transport it, for when a sled might be used for that purpose
there is always enough snow from which to erect a shelter.</p>

<p>During the winter the skins are stored away on posts erected for the
purpose, or on piles of rocks where the various species of small animals
will not destroy them by eating holes in the oily skin. Mice and ermines
are very destructive to these skins, often causing sad havoc in a short
time. By the spring the owner may be miles away from the scene of the
previous autumnal hunt and be unable to go after the tent, which, with
the summer rain and decay, becomes useless, imposing the severe task of
collecting skins for a second tent.</p>

<p>In former times these people inhabited permanent winter houses like
those used by the Eskimo elsewhere, as is shown by the ruins of sod and
stone houses to be seen in various parts of the country. These appear to
have had walls of stone built up to support the roof timbers, with the
interstices filled up with turf or earth. From the depression remaining
in the inside of these ruins, the floor seems to have been excavated to
a greater or less depth.</p>

<p>The present inhabitants relate that their ancestors dwelt in these
huts, but can not explain why they were deserted, or why such structures
are not erected at the present day.</p>

HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES.</a></h5>

<p>There is very little in these dwellings that can be called furniture,
besides the bed places already referred to. The other articles requisite
for housekeeping consist of a lamp of soapstone, kettles to hang over
it, a&nbsp;frame suspended above the lamp for drying various articles,
and sundry wooden bowls, buckets, and cups, besides similar vessels made
of sealskin.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page229" id =
"page229">229</a></span>
<p>The lamp (poqíla), which is the only source of heat and light in the
snow house, is, roughly speaking, a&nbsp;large shallow bowl of soapstone
filled with oil, which is burned by means of a wick of moss, arranged
round one edge of the bowl.</p>

<p>The general form of these lamps, which will be best understood from
the figures (Figs. 49, 50,&nbsp;51), is nearly always the same, the
variations being apparently due to the lack of material. The cavity for
holding the oil varies in capacity, according to the size of the lamp,
from half a pint to nearly three quarts. It is, however, never filled to
the brim, for fear it should run over. The consumption of oil depends
upon the number of wicks lighted at once, and also on the character of
the wick.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 52.</span> Frame for drying mittens.</p>

<p>The wick in general use is prepared from a kind of moss, which grows
in large patches close to the ground, the stalks rising perpendicularly,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page230" id =
"page230">230</a></span>
and the whole so matted together that it may be cut into any desired
form. From these patches pieces are cut an inch or two wide,
a&nbsp;third of an inch thick and two or three inches in length, and
laid away to dry. When one of these is to be used the woman squeezes the
fibers together with her teeth, trims it, and sets it in the oil, and
lights it. The light from one of these wicks is nearly equal to that of
an inch wick fed with a good quality of kerosene. The heat is very
great. For cooking, a&nbsp;larger wick is used, or two of the smaller
ones set side by side. Over the lamp is placed a frame for drying wet
boots, mittens, and such things. Fig. 52 represents one of these
(No.&nbsp;3048), which is a semicircle or bow of wood with the ends
fastened to a straight piece of wood. Across these strands of sinew or
sealskin forms a sort of netting
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page231" id =
"page231">231</a></span>
having large meshes. On this rests the article to be dried. Under this
is a support formed of two sharp-pointed pegs which are stuck into the
snow forming the side of the hut. On the outer end of these is fastened,
or laid across them, a&nbsp;piece of wood. The shape of the support is
that of a long staple with square corners. In some instances the pegs
form only a wide V-shape, and the frame for supporting the articles laid
directly on this. A&nbsp;block of wood hollowed out to receive the
convex bottom of the lamp is sometimes used to support the latter.</p>

<p>In former times cooking over these lamps was universally performed in
kettles of soapstone, in which cooking was also done by putting heated
stones into the water. These soapstone kettles are, however, quite
superseded by utensils of civilized manufacture. I, however, succeeded
in collecting two full-sized stone kettles, and one little one, made for
a child’s toy. The figures (Figs. 53,&nbsp;54) show the shape of these
vessels sufficiently well. The handles are made of strips of whalebone.
The larger kettle (No.&nbsp;3179) is nearly 13 inches long, and will
hold nearly a gallon. They were made of different capacities in former
times, varying from about a pint to a full gallon.</p>

one of

bucket are a strip of seal skin bent into a ring, with a round piece of
seal skin sewed on for a bottom. Sometimes a seal-skin bail is added, or
a wooden handle sewed to the lips of the cup, making it into a dipper
(Figs. 56,&nbsp;57.) Wooden baskets are made in a <ins class =

<p>The capacity of these vessels is seldom more than a couple of quarts,
and generally less. They are principally used to ladle water into the
cooking kettles. All these vessels of native manufacture are being
rapidly displaced by tin cups and small kettles.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_food" id = "kokso_food">
FOOD AND ITS PREPARATION<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></a></h5>

<p>Under certain conditions a great portion of their food is eaten raw,
but it is invariably cooked when it conveniently can be. Frozen food is
consumed in great quantities. I&nbsp;have seen them strip and devour the
back, fat, and flesh from the body of a deer while the fibers were yet
quivering. The entrails of many species of birds are taken from the body
and, while yet warm, swallowed much after the manner of swallowing an
oyster. The eggs which have been incubated to an advanced degree are as
eagerly devoured as those quite fresh.</p>

<p>The deer meat, killed the previous fall and frozen for three or four
months, is cut into huge chunks and gnawed with as much satisfaction as
though it was the finest pastry. On such occasions I have seen the
person appointed to chop up the frozen meat scatter the pieces among the
expectant crowd with as little ceremony as that of throwing ears of corn
to the hogs in a pen. For a change the frozen pieces of meat are
sometimes warmed or thawed before the fire.</p>

<p>The blood of the deer is often mixed with the half-digested mass of
food in the stomach of the animal, and the stomach, with its contents,
with the addition of the blood, eaten raw or boiled. Sometimes it is
laid aside to ferment and then frozen and eaten in this condition.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page233" id =
"page233">233</a></span>
<p>Strips of fat from a seal and the blood of the animal are put into a
kettle and heated. The oily liquid is eaten with the greatest relish.
Seal oil is used for food in about the same manner as we use syrups.
Years of almost daily intercourse with these people have failed to show
the ability of any person to drink seal or whale oil without illness
resulting. They never drink pure oil under any circumstances, except as
a laxative. The statement often made that these people drink oil as food
is simply preposterous. Such statements doubtless arose from seeing
other preparations of food having an abundance of oil upon them. Lean
flesh is often dipped into oil and then eaten. If partaken of without
oil in as great quantities as these people require, a&nbsp;torpid
condition of the liver and alimentary canal results, and they thus
employ the pure oil to relieve themselves.</p>

<p>Vegetable food is little used except in the vicinity of the trading
stations. Those accustomed to the use of flour, bread, peas, beans, and
rice are very fond of them, and often express regret that they will be
deprived of them when on their hunting expeditions.</p>

<p>Native plants afford little help as food. During the season when the
various berries are ripe all the people gorge themselves. They have a
special fondness for the akpik (<i>Rubus chœmomorus</i>). The sun
scarcely reddens the side of these berries, locally known as “bake
apple,” before the children scour the tracts where they grow, and eat of
the half-ripened fruit with as much relish as the civilized boy does the
fruit purloined from a neighbor’s orchard. Other berries contribute
their share as food.</p>

<p>When on trips the women often gather a few green herbs and put them
in a kettle of water and make an infusion in lieu of tea. They are fond
of tea, coffee, and sugar. Molasses is eaten alone or with something
dipped in it.</p>

<p>The Eskimo drink often and astonishing quantities of water at a time.
If the weather be very cold they often drink the water which has been
heated on a fire, asserting that the hot water does not weaken them as
much as cold water would do.</p>

<p>When a seal has been killed and is being brought to camp, the hunter
signifies his success from a distance, and those in camp raise a joyous
shout. The animal is drawn ashore and skinned. The flesh is devoured raw
as the process goes on, or may be divided, certain portions being given
the different persons. The blood is collected, and when the meat is
boiled it is mixed with the hot liquid and forms a nutritious dish,
eagerly devoured by both adults and young. The children revel in this
dish to a sacrifice of cleanliness.</p>

<p>The feast is continued until the flesh has been devoured and the
people gorged to their utmost capacity. Stories are told and general
good humor prevails. The different species of fish which frequent the
shallow waters of the bays are used as food.</p>

TOBACCO AND SNUFF.</a></h5>

<p>All the adults are addicted to the use of tobacco, both for smoking
and chewing and in the form of snuff, although it is not everyone that
uses tobacco in all three ways.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 58.</span> Tobacco pouch.</p>
</div>

<p>The plug tobacco, used for smoking and chewing, is carried in a small
pouch of seal skin attached to the belt, which keeps it from being
dampened by perspiration or rain. Watches are also carried in the same
receptacle. Fig. 58 (No.&nbsp;74485) is such a bag, made of hairy seal
skin. The edges alone are trimmed with lighter colored strips of seal
skin. A&nbsp;string holds the mouth of the bag together after it is
rolled up. A&nbsp;loop at one corner enables the bearer to affix it to
his belt when traveling to avoid the necessity of opening the bag in
which he usually carries such small things.</p>

<p>Leaf tobacco is preferred for the preparation of snuff, but as this
is not always to be had plug is often used. This is shredded up and
dried, and when dry enough is reduced to a powder by inclosing a
quantity in a fold of seal skin and pounding it with a stone or
stick.</p>

<p>Snuff is kept in a purse-shaped bag, closed at the mouth with a
thong. To it is attached a little spoon made of ivory. Various forms of
this implement are made. The general appearance is that of a common
spoon, of which the ends and sides of the bowl are cut off. At the end
of the handle is a slight depression for containing the snuff, which is
held firmly against the orifice of the nostril and inhaled by a sudden
indrawing of the breath while the thumb of the other hand closes the
opposite nostril.</p>

<p>The old women appear more addicted to the use of snuff than any of
the men. The effect of inhaling the strong snuff is quickly shown in the
face. It seems to affect people more than the use of tobacco in any
other way.</p>

MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.</a></h5>

BY WATER.</a></h6>

<p>The principal means of conveyance by water with the Eskimo of Hudson
strait, is the umiak, referred to by most writers as the woman’s boat.
This appellation is not more applicable than would be the term family
boat. The women use the boat alone only on rare occasions, and then in
quiet water and for short distances. Men are nearly always in it, and
under the guidance of one of these, the boat is used for long
journeys.</p>

<p>The form of the umiak, in the region under consideration, differs
greatly from that of the Eskimo of Bering sea. (See Fig. 59, from a
model.)</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig59" id = "fig59"> </a>
<img src = "images/fig59.png" width = "430" height = "107"
alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 59.</span> Eskimo umiak.</p>

<p>The size of the boat is variable according to the means of the
builder and the size of the family to be conveyed in it. The length of
the keel is from 10 to 25 feet. Over all the length is 1 or 2 feet
greater than on the keel. It will be thus seen that the ends are nearly
perpendicular. It is difficult to determine at the first glance which is
the bow and which the stern, so nearly alike are they. They only differ
in the former being somewhat wider at the upper edge or rail.</p>

<p>The keel is a straight piece of wood hewed from a single stick,
nearly 4 inches square. The stem and stern posts are nearly alike, the
latter having but little slope, and are cut from curved or crooked stems
of trees. A&nbsp;tree may be found, which, when hewed, will form the
sternpost and keel in one length. Otherwise the fore and aft posts have
places cut out for the insertion of the respective ends of the keel, and
are fastened firmly by stout thongs of sealskin thrust through holes
bored in the wood and ingeniously lashed. As the bottom of the umiak is
flat the sides of the bottom are formed of square rails of sufficient
length and given the desired spread. They are held at the ends by being
joined to the keel. Crosspieces notched at the ends separate the bottom
rails and are steadied in position by being notched so as to sit on the
square keel. On the ends of the crosspieces is laid a second rail which
prevents them from rising and serves to strengthen the ends of the ribs,
which are set alternately with the crosspieces of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page236" id =
"page236">236</a></span>
keel. The ribs are attached to the lower or bottom rail by means of
sealskin lashing. Along the upper ends of the ribs is placed a longer
rail of smaller diameter and usually shaved round. This rail is usually
set half its diameter into rounded notches of the upper ends of the ribs
and fastened by thongs. Within and below the top rail is a shorter rail,
generally smaller than the upper, tied by thongs to the ribs and posts
fore and aft. A&nbsp;wide board projecting several inches on each side
of the stern serves as a seat for the steersman. The ends of the top
rails are laid over this board and attached to it. A&nbsp;similar board
is placed at the forward end or bow, but is, of course, longer as that
end is the wider of the two.</p>

<p>Three to five thwarts, serving as seats for the occupants, are placed
at proper intervals, having their ends resting on the inside top rail.
One of these thwarts also serves to steady the mast, which is stepped
into the keel and lashed to the thwart.</p>

<p>On the side of the boat and resting on the top rail are pieces of
wood firmly lashed. A&nbsp;notch, or rowlock, is cut into them to serve
as rests for the heavy oars. The oars are held into the notch by means
of loops of stout thong, the ends of the loops passing each other, one
from forward and the other from aft, and through both of the loop ends
the inner end of the oar is thrust. The loops serve to hold the oar when
not in use, otherwise it would float away; yet the position of them
allows the oars to lie alongside in the water. The oars are heavy and as
much as 10 feet long for a large umiak. The women generally run the boat
and are assisted by the younger men of the party who may not be walking
along the shore. Two or more females sit side by side and if they be
insufficient a third person faces them and assists in the labor. It is a
favorite place for a young man with his sweetheart. The steersman sits
on the after board and attends to the helm and sail when the latter is
in use. The sail is a nearly square sheet of cloth spread by a yard
across the top. The lower corners have each a rope which the helmsman
holds. A&nbsp;fair wind only can be used to advantage as the <ins class
= "correction" title = "spelling unchanged: elsewhere ‘umiak’">oomiak</ins>, from its flat bottom, is unable to go to
windward. With a breeze nearly aft they can be made to sail at a good
speed.</p>

<p>The covering of the umiak is made of skins of the largest seals. The
skins are freed from hair and all adhering flesh and fat, and stretched
to their utmost tension.</p>

<p>They are then cut into the proper shape and sewed together. The edge
of one skin overlaps that of the other and the lap is then tacked over
the shorter edge and attached to the other skin so as to form two seams
at each junction.</p>

<p>Those portions which are to cover the bottom are sewed with special
care, as the seams are liable to be strained in shoving the boat over
the oars when it is taken from the water at each camp. When skins are
sewed side to side in sufficient number to fit the length of the frame
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page237" id =
"page237">237</a></span>
they are lifted around it and temporarily placed in position. The
superfluous portions are cut out or additional pieces put in until it
fits properly on the frame. Holes, 3&nbsp;or 4 inches apart, are cut in
the edges of the skin and stout thongs are passed through these and over
the top rail to the inner rail. All the strength of the individual is
now applied to draw the skin over the top rail. Being wet it readily
stretches, and when the entire covering is drawn sufficiently tight the
lashing around the rail is permanently fastened. The boat is then turned
keel up to dry. If the skin has been properly cut and stretched it
sounds like a drum when struck.</p>

<p>When in use the greatest care must be exercised to prevent contact
with rocks, but in shallow water it frequently happens that a hole is
cut in the skin of the boat, when the rent must be patched with a piece
of skin. During the winter months the umiak is placed on staging of
posts to protect it from the ravages of mice and other animals.</p>

<p>Journeys of considerable length are undertaken in these boats.
A&nbsp;large family, or two or more families, may remove to a distance
to try their fortunes. They always stop at night and during bad weather,
and the journey is accomplished by easy stages. All the portable
possessions of the family are taken in these boats, which are often
loaded to such a degree that the older people have to walk along the
shores and only go into the umiak to relieve some one who desires to
walk. Where the beach is good a tracking line is attached to the bow and
those on shore drag the boat along. The dogs which accompany the party
are sometimes harnessed and made to pull. The tracking line is called
into requisition whenever a trip is made up a river to the hunting
grounds for reindeer.</p>

<p>The kaiak or skin canoe used by the Eskimo of Hudson strait belongs
to the Greenland type. It is quite different from that used by the
natives of Alaska. These boats vary from 18 to 26 feet in length; the
greatest width, one-third of the distance aft the hole where the rower
sits, being one-seventh to one-ninth of the entire length of the kaiak.
The ends are sharp, the prow much more acute than the stern. The bottom
is quite flat and the frame for the keel and sides at the bottom is
arranged similarly to that of the umiak. The prow is simply an extension
of the keel and slopes above the water to a height nearly double that of
the stern. The slope of the stern is gradual and short. The side timbers
at the bottom have the upper surface gouged so as to allow the lower
ends of the nearly perpendicular ribs to rest in the groove. The ribs
extend across the bottom, resting on the side timber and keel. Their
upper ends are inserted in the upper rail, which extends the entire
length of the kaiak. The upper rails are held apart by crosspieces of
different lengths, according to position. On the top of these upper
crosspieces is laid a piece which extends to the nose of the kaiak.
A&nbsp;similar, but shorter one, is laid
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page238" id =
"page238">238</a></span>
from the hole where the rower sits to the stern of the kaiak. The hole
for his body is placed between a pair of crossbars where the equilibrium
will be best maintained. The hoop of wood which outlines the hole is
variable in shape, but resembles half of a short ellipse, the posterior
of which is slightly curved to fit the back of the rower. Just forward
of the seat the upper surface of the canoe is somewhat elevated by the
curvature of the crossbars, and it thus enables the rower to have
greater freedom for his limbs than he otherwise would. This particular
part, the elevation just forward of him, alone resembles any portion of
the kaiaks used by the Alaskan Eskimo, and of these, only the sub-tribes
in the vicinity of Bering strait [and thence to Point
Barrow.&mdash;<span class = "smallroman">J.&nbsp;M.</span>] have that
part of the kaiak so fashioned. With that exception the top of the
Hudson strait kaiak is flat on the top. Just forward of the hatch, two
or three stout thongs are sewed to the outer edge of each side of the
boat and extend across the top. A&nbsp;similar thong is placed behind.
Under these thongs are placed the paddle, also the spears, and other
hunting gear. Small game is sometimes tied to these.</p>

<p>The outfit, consisting of spears and their appurtenances, properly
belongs with the kaiak. Of these implements, there are different kinds,
depending on the game and the season of the year. As the kaiak is used
only during the seasons of open water it is laid aside during the
winter.</p>

<p>I remember an instance occurring opposite Fort Chimo. A kaiak had
been left until the ice in the river was firm enough to enable the
vessel to be brought over on it to the station. One day a woman declared
that she could see a wolf tearing the skin from the frame. It was
scarcely credited, but in the course of half an hour the wolf started
across towards the post. It was met and showed some disposition to
attack, but was shot. I&nbsp;watched to see where the men went to look
at the kaiak, and when they reached the place I was astounded that the
woman could discern even the kaiak at such a distance.</p>

<p>The spear used for white whales and large seals consists of a wooden
shaft of 6 or 8 feet in length, having a projection on the side, made of
ivory and shaped like the fin of a fish. This fin-shaped piece rests
against the forefinger, while the remainder of the hand grasps the
shaft. The lower end of the shaft terminates in a piece of bone or ivory
of 1 to 1⅓ inches in diameter. (<a href = "#fig67">Fig.&nbsp;67.</a>)
A&nbsp;socket is made in the end of the bone portion, and the wooden
shaft is nicely fitted into it and fastened either by thongs or rivets.
At the farther end of the bone head is a thimble-shaped hole gouged out,
and into this a short piece of straight bone or ivory is fitted, having
the ends so shaped that they will work smoothly into the hole at the end
of the bone head of the spear. The farther end of this bone shaft is so
shaped that it will work into the bone or ivory portion of the piece
into which the spear point is fastened. The point is shown in the
accompanying figure (<a href = "#fig67">Fig.&nbsp;68</a>) and is not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page239" id =
"page239">239</a></span>
much varied in general shape. There are two joints between the spear
point and the bone shaft head. This enables the spear-point to become
easily detached when the game is pierced. If this were not so, the bone
or ivory would soon break with the violent motions of the animal, and
the implement would be rendered useless until repaired. Thongs connect
the various parts together, also connecting them with the main shaft of
the spear. A&nbsp;long line, usually left lying in a coil just in front
of the hunter, gives ample scope for play until the animal is exhausted.
If the sea is rough or the hunter unable to cope with the quarry, the
float, to be described below, is thrown over and the seal or whale
allowed to take its course, the hunter following and endeavoring to
harass the animal as much as possible, giving it a stab with the hand
spear whenever occasion offers.</p>

<p>In addition to the whale or seal spear, the hand spear, float, and
paddle, the kaiaker may have a wooden shaft, on the end of which are
three prongs of barbed iron, each prong 8 to 10 inches long, and set in
the form of a divergent trident. With this implement, small seals and
the white-coated young are killed. Birds, too, are sometimes speared
with this trident.</p>

<p>The hand board, or implement with which certain spears are hurled, is
a piece of wood of such shape that a description will give but little
idea of its form. It is about 14 inches long, flat, and has a groove on
one side into which the rear end of the spear shaft rests, and is
supported by the three fingers of the hand while the index finger fits
into a hole cut through the board, of the shape to accommodate that
digit. The tip of the finger rests against the shaft of the spear. Other
notches are cut along the side of the board to enable the three fingers
to lie in position to give a firm grasp on the end or handle of the
board. The thumb turns over so as to lie directly on the spear, to
steady it, while the other fingers give the spear the necessary straight
motion when the arm is drawn back and raised nearly perpendicularly.
When it reaches that position the motion is arrested and the fingers
release the implement held along the groove. The hand board or thrower
is retained and the spear recovered if the object has not been struck.
If the aim was good the spear remains attached to the struggling animal,
and the hand board is quickly placed under one of the thongs stretched
across the top of the kaiak. The paddle is held in the left hand and
ready for instant use.</p>

<p>The paddle is quite heavy and of variable length, having long, narrow
blades, which are alternately dipped into the water. The use of the
paddle requires some practice before one becomes accustomed to it. When
in use the paddle rests on the edge of the hoop, forming the rim of the
hatch, and moves along it in the motion of propulsion.</p>

<p>As the paddle dips into the water the dripping often causes the
clothing to become wet. To obviate this, these people use a piece of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page240" id =
"page240">240</a></span>
plaited rope or skin to slip nearly to the beginning of the blade. This
causes the dripping to fall outside of the kaiak; and in cold weather is
very necessary, unless heavy mittens of tanned sealskin be worn.</p>

<p>An implement used for hooking into the body of a sunken seal or whale
is made in the following manner: A&nbsp;piece of wood is prepared about
8 feet long and three-fourths of an inch thick, having a width of an
inch and a half. The lower end of this has a strong hook made of stout
iron set into it. Along the inner edge of the wooden shaft two or three
notches are cut. The end near the person has a V-shaped notch cut into
it. This is used for all the purposes of a boat hook, and also to
retrieve a sunken animal. A&nbsp;weight is attached to near the hook end
to keep the shaft perpendicular in the water. A&nbsp;line of sufficient
length is attached to it. The hunter has marked the locality, and with
the hook “feels” the bottom for the game. When found the hook is jerked
into the skin and the object brought to the surface. The staff is very
necessary while the kaiak is being moved through narrow channels among
the ice fields. It is, in fact, available in many instances where the
paddle would, from its length, be useless. The kaiak outfit would be
incomplete without the hook.</p>

<p>A young man starts out in life with a gun and ammunition with which
to procure game. If he has the energy to become a successful hunter he
will soon be able to make a kaiak, and thus procure the marine mammals
whose skins will afford a covering for an umiak and in the course of
time additional skins for a tent. These possessions usually come in the
order laid down, and when they are all procured he is generally able to
have others under his direction assist in transporting them from place
to place; and thus he becomes the head of a gens or family, including
his brothers and sisters with their husbands, wives, and children. These
usually move in a body wherever the head may dictate, and all their
possessions accompany them on the journey. Brothers often live together
and own the tent and umiak, the remainder of the household affairs being
considered as individual property and not to be used by all without
permission.</p>

<p>Some of the men are too improvident to prepare these skins when they
have the opportunity, and thus they are unable to own a kaiak, which
prevents them from providing themselves with the umiak and tent. These
persons must live with others or dwell by themselves and pass a
miserable existence, scarcely noticed by their fellows even during a
season of abundance.</p>

<p>The collection contains one full-sized kaiak, with all its fittings,
and their models, including a toy kaiak cut from a walrus tusk. The
model is just 9 inches long and quite perfect in form. The double-bladed
paddle accompanying is made from the same material, and is six inches
long.</p>


<h6><a name = "kokso_trans_land" id = "kokso_trans_land">
ON LAND.</a></h6>

<p>The universal means of transportation on land is the sled, drawn by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page241" id =
"page241">241</a></span>
dogs. The number of dogs used to draw a sled varies according to the
distance to be traveled, the character of the country, the condition of
the animals, and the weight of the load to be drawn. From one to twenty
dogs may be used. The common team for general purposes is seven or nine
animals.</p>

<p>The method of constructing sleds differs slightly in different parts
of the region, and then only where the material may be difficult to
obtain or a heavy sled may not be needed. A&nbsp;tree of a suitable size
is selected, generally larch, because of its greater strength, although
somewhat heavier than the spruce.</p>

<p>It is necessary, for greater strength, that each runner be of a
single piece of timber. The length of the runner is from 12 to 16 feet;
the height varies from 10 to 12 inches. The piece must be as nearly free
from knots and crossgrain as possible, for these defects render the wood
very brittle during cold weather. The runners are roughly hewn at the
place where originally cut, and, when needed, they are brought to the
temporary camping place of the Eskimo, and there dressed with plane and
saw to the required form. The bottom of the runner is usually 2½ to 3
inches thick, gradually becoming thinner by one-half an inch to an inch
toward the top. This enables the sled to make a wider track at the
bottom and encounter less friction of the runner sides against the snow
crust. The curve at the forward end is long and very gradual. There may
be as much as 3 feet of the curved part, which rises above the level of
the lower edge of the runner. This enables the sled to creep easily over
any obstruction. The runners are now placed parallel, separated by a
distance of 14 to 16 inches, and on these are fastened crossbars 3
inches wide, of sufficient length to allow about an inch to project over
the outer edge of each runner. Near the ends of these slats is cut a
notch on each edge. Sometimes a hole is also bored through the slat
between the notches. These are for the purpose of fastening the slats to
the runners. A&nbsp;sufficient number having been prepared, and placed 1
or 2 inches apart, they are now laid on the flat top of the runner.
Holes are bored through the top of the runner to correspond with the
holes and notches of the slats. Through these and over the slats a stout
piece of heavy sealskin line is threaded, and so on through and over the
slats and runner until it is firmly fastened. The line must be well
soaked in water to render it flexible and allow it to stretch, otherwise
the joints where it was tied would soon work loose. The line shrinks
while drying, and draws as tight as though made of the best iron. No
metal is used, for the reason that it would snap as easily as chalk
during cold weather. The use of the thongs in binding the slats to the
runners allows freedom to the motion of the sled when passing over
inequalities of surface, where a rigidity of the sled would soon cause
it to break. The bottom of the runner is shod with iron brought by the
traders for that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page242" id =
"page242">242</a></span>
purpose. It is simply extra-wide hoop-iron and of a width to fit. It is
fastened on with screws, the heads of which are countersunk.</p>

<p>Another kind of shoe is put on when traveling in very cold weather.
A&nbsp;swampy track is searched for soil of half-decomposed vegetation
and pure humus, as nearly free from sand and gravel as possible. It must
possess certain qualities or it may not have the requisite
strength&mdash;much, I&nbsp;presume, as mortar often requires to be
tempered with more or less lime or sand when it is too rich or too poor.
The Eskimo tempers his mortar with the almost impalpable soil found
under the larger spreading trees of the forest. It is the slowly
decomposed vegetation fallen from branches and trunks. The manner of
preparing it is as follows: A&nbsp;large kettle is partially filled with
the material and heated to the boiling point, being constantly stirred,
and while yet cool enough all coarse sticks, grass blades, pebbles,
etc., are carefully removed as the fingers discover them in working the
mortar. The sled is turned over with the bottom of the runner up. The
mud is now applied by the hands, a&nbsp;couple of pounds being taken and
pressed on the runner, which has previously been wetted. This process of
adding to the runner is continued until it attains an additional depth
of 3 or 4 inches and a width of 3 to 5 inches. It now resembles the rail
of a stairway. When it has been thoroughly gone over to fill up any
inequalities the sled is set aside in order that the mud may freeze
solid. The sled must be handled with care, as the least jar or jolt will
break the “setting” mud. After it is frozen the owner takes a plane and
planes it down to the proper shape and smoothness. It is somewhat
difficult to describe the shape in words, unless it be compared to the
upper part of the <span class = "sans">T</span> rail of a railroad
inverted&mdash;neither rounded nor flat, but so fashioned as to give the
best bearing surface with the least friction. When the plane has
finished its work the color of the mud is a rich chestnut brown. The
builder now takes water in his mouth and spirts it in a spray along the
mud. As soon as the water touches the runner it must be spread evenly
with a hand incased in a mitten of reindeer skin, rubbing back and forth
until the runner looks like a bar of black glass. The sled is then ready
for use. Great care is necessary to avoid rocks or stones, as these cut
the polished mud and roughen it. If a sudden lurch causes a portion of
the mud to drop out the piece is frozen on again by means of water, or
if crumbled a piece of ice is cut to the shape and caused to adhere by
water freezing it to the runner.</p>

<p>It is not often that one may find a sled shod with bone, as is the
custom with the Eskimo farther north, and especially farther west. The
only instance where I have seen bone used was by some of the people from
the western extremity of Hudson strait. These had only a portion of the
curve and a part of the runner shod with bone and pieces of reindeer
horn, secured to the runner by means of pegs.</p>

<p>The greatest objection to the use of mud is that a few hours of
warmth may cause it to loosen and render it worthless. The polish
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page243" id =
"page243">243</a></span>
suffers when traveling over rough ice, and especially where sand has
drifted from some exposed bank to the surface of the snow. This causes
very hard pulling, and soon roughens the running surface of the sled. To
repair such damage the native stops, at a convenient place, to obtain
water, which is spirted on the runner and rubbed evenly until it
acquires a thickness of one-eighth of an inch. This coating of ice may
last for the entire day of travel where the “roads” are good.</p>

<p>The harness for the dogs consists of two large nooses, placed one
above the other. These are joined by two perpendicular straps of 4 or 5
inches in length at a sufficient distance from the end to allow the head
of the dog to pass through so that one noose will lie along the back and
the other between the forelegs. At the rear ends of the nooses is a long
thong of the heaviest sealskin of variable length depending on the
position or place the dog is to have in the team. The body harness is
made of sealskin, with or without the hair on, stout canvas, or other
material which may be convenient. Thin undressed sealskin makes the best
harness, and is not so liable to chafe the neck of the animal. The trace
attached to each dog is generally of stout sealskin thong cut
three-eighths of an inch wide, and the corners are carefully pared until
the trace in form resembles a hoop for a small keg. The trace varies
from 10 to 30 feet in length, and is attached to a longer but much
stouter thong of heavier sealskin or walrus hide prepared in the form
described for the trace. The thong to which all of the traces of
variable lengths are fastened is termed the “bridle.” The bridle has,
usually, apiece of ivory, called “toggle,” at the end farthest from the
sled. A&nbsp;few inches back of the toggle is a short piece of stout
thong plaited in the bridle end. This thong has a slit cut in the
farther end. It is passed through slits cut in the end of each trace and
then looped on the toggle. It will now be understood that the traces all
start from one place, but their different lengths give different
positions to the dogs of the team so that they may move freely among
rough pieces of ice without interfering with each other. This has some
advantages, but it necessitates watching the traces as they are liable
to catch around any projection above the surface.</p>

<p>The bridles are also of varying lengths, from 15 to 40 feet. The rear
end has two stout thongs plaited into it, forming a loop for each thong.
These are known as the “yoke,” and are looped over toggles, one on each
inner side of the runner.</p>

<p>Any load to be carried on the sled is usually placed so as not to
project much over the side, for in deep snow, with a crust too weak to
support the weight, it would simply act as a drag and seriously impede
travel if not entirely stop it. The load must also be distributed to the
best advantage along the sled so as not to have too great a weight at
either the front or rear, although generally a heavier portion is placed
behind to allow the sled to steer or follow. The runners are so low
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page244" id =
"page244">244</a></span>
that the sled seldom upsets unless the ice is very rough, in which case
it often requires two men to attend to it, another to free the traces
from obstructions, and a fourth to lead or drive the dogs.
A&nbsp;smaller number render traveling under such conditions very
tedious.</p>

<p>The driver is always armed with a whip (Fig. 60). There appear to be
as many kinds of whips as there are individuals using them. Each whip
characterizes, in a manner, the person who makes it. A&nbsp;great amount
of ingenuity is expended in preparing the lash, which is simply
indescribable. The handle of the whip is from 9 to 11 inches in length
and shaped somewhat like the handle of a sword without the guard.
A&nbsp;stout loop of thong is affixed to the stock above where the hand
grasps it. This loop is thrown over the wrist to prevent the weight of
the whip drawing the stock from the hand and also to retain the whip
when it is allowed to trail behind.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 60.</span> Dog whip.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the stock a portion of the wood is cut out to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page245" id =
"page245">245</a></span>
allow the insertion of the end of the lash which is fastened by means of
finer thongs. The butt end of the lash is five-sixteenths of an inch
thick and nearly 2 inches wide. It is composed of eight heavy thongs
plaited in a peculiar manner, depending on the number of thongs used and
the fancy of the maker. The thongs are plaited by inserting the end of
each thong through a succession of slits cut at the proper distance and
so matted together that it is difficult to determine the “run” of the
thong. The size decreases from the handle by dropping out a strand until
at 18 inches from the stock only four thongs are left, and these form a
square plait for a foot in length. This square form is succeeded by only
two thongs which make a flat plait of 2 feet in length. At the end of
this a simple piece of heavy thong completes the lash. The length of a
whip may be as much as 35 feet, weighing 3 or 4 pounds. Some of the
natives acquire a surprising dexterity with this formidable weapon,
often being able to snip the ear of a particular dog at a distance of
the length of the whip. I&nbsp;have known them to snap the head from a
ptarmigan, sitting along the path of the team. Children practice with
the whip as soon as they can manage it.</p>

<p>The Eskimo dog fears nothing but the whiplash. They attack each other
with savage ferocity, and several dogs may be engaged in terrific
battles, yet the swish of a whip or even a stick thrown hurtling through
the air is sufficient to cause them to slink off in abject terror,
whining piteously in fear of the expected lash.</p>

<p>The weight or load put upon a sled may be as much as 1,200 pounds.
The character of the road alone determines the weight, number of dogs,
and rate of travel. The latter may average over a smooth surface 5 miles
hourly for twelve hours continuously, excluding the few minutes given
the dogs to “blow” (rest), etc. I&nbsp;knew an instance where three men
with empty sled and seven dogs traveled 94 miles in eighteen hours.
I&nbsp;have gone 19 miles in three hours; and again I have known only 3
or 4 miles to be made in ten hours, through rough ice or deep, newly
fallen snow.</p>

<p>The disposition and condition of the dogs chiefly determines the
number attached to the sled. With these animals there is the same
difference as is to be found in horses or other beasts of draft. Some
are energetic and well-behaved; others as stubborn or lazy as is
possible. Strange dogs in the team are liable to be pitched upon by all
the others and with the long traces ensues such an entanglement of
lines, dogs, and flying snow as is difficult to conceive. The good
qualities of the driver are manifested by his ability in keeping the
dogs in order and showing promptness in separating them when quarreling.
Fighting among the dogs can always be prevented by the driver keeping
the dogs in proper position.</p>

<p>It is made of larch wood and has a backing of eight double strands of
twisted sinew. This sinew is in one piece sixteen times the length of
the bow. One end is looped and passed over one “nock” of the bow and
carried back and forth from nock to nock eight times. This backing has
two turns of twist put in from the middle to increase its elasticity,
and is lashed to the middle of the bow with a stout thong of reindeer
skin. The bowstring is of twisted sinew with a loop at each end.</p>

<p>With this bow were seven arrows. Three of these are for shooting
reindeer and wolves. They have an iron point set in a short foreshaft of
reindeer antler, and a wooden shaft about 16 inches long (Fig.&nbsp;63).
Three more are pointed with large nails, one of which has been beaten to
a chisel-shaped point (Figs. 64 and&nbsp;65). They are intended for
large game at short range, or for small game, such as hares and
ptarmigan. These six arrows are feathered with the tail feathers of the
raven. The last arrow is a simple shaft, without feathering or head, and
is intended for small game, such as a wood hare crouching under a spruce
tree, or the little red squirrel on the top of a low tree.</p>

<p>In drawing the bow, the Innuit invariably hold the arrow between the
middle two fingers of the right hand, and the string is drawn with all
four fingers, and released by straightening them.</p>

<p>The bow and arrows are carried in bow case and quiver fastened
together and slung on the back. Fig. 66 represents a model
(No.&nbsp;3257) of such a bow case. The bow case is made of buckskin and
is of sufficient length to contain
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page247" id =
"page247">247</a></span>
the bow, excepting the extreme end, which is left projecting for
convenience in handling. The case is tied around the bow at the
projecting end. The quiver is attached to the bow case and contains two
models of arrows for shooting large game. The arrows are tipped with
leaf-shaped pieces of tin. They are feathered with portions of feathers
apparently taken from the tail of a raven. The mouth of the quiver is
also drawn up with a string to prevent the loss of arrows. I&nbsp;have
not seen the Eskimo of Hudson strait use such a cover for their bows and
arrows, but the opportunities to observe them are very limited, as few
are used. I&nbsp;am led to conclude that only the poorer individuals of
either locality have the bow and arrow at the present day.</p>

killing white whales when they have been driven into a shallow arm of
the sea when the tide ebbs and leaves them partly uncovered. It has a
short wooden shaft with a ferrule of ivory, holding a short ivory loose
shaft, kept in place by thongs, on which is mounted a toggle head like
that used on the big harpoon. The line is either attached to the kaiak
or to a small float made of the inflated intestine or skin of a seal.
The toggle heads for these spears are made of ivory, and fitted with
iron blades (Fig.&nbsp;68). I&nbsp;have already referred to the large

<p>Fig. 69 (No. 3531) is such a large sealskin float or á va tuk. The

scraped to free it from all fleshy matter. The hind flippers are cut off
at the ankle and the skin either sewed or stoutly wrapped with thong.
The fore flippers are usually left
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page248" id =
"page248">248</a></span>
attached to the skin after the flesh has been scraped from them. The
skin is now inflated with air and hung up to dry. In a few hours it is
turned with the hairy side out and again inflated for awhile. The mouth
and all other openings in the skin are carefully sewed up. A&nbsp;large
button of ivory, shaped much like a pulley, nearly 2 inches in diameter,
is put where the mouth of the skin is and a portion of the skin
carefully wrapped around it, thongs of sealskin tightening the moist
skin in the groove of the mouthpiece. This piece has a hole about
one-third of an inch in diameter bored through it. The hind flippers and
tail have a stick of 2 or 3 inches in length placed within the skin and
are then firmly bound around the stick, which serves to stop up any hole
and also to furnish a handle by which to drag or hold the float. The
hole in the mouth-piece is plugged with a stopper of wood. When the
float is wanted for use the skin is inflated. When inflated the float
has a diameter about two-thirds the length. If it is to be attached to a
tracking line the float is fastened by the stick, which is secured
within the skin of the hind flippers and dragged backwards. The function
of the float in this instance is to prevent the tracking line from
becoming “fouled” among the rocks and stones of the beach along which
the line runs in towing a boat (or&nbsp;umiak). In a similar manner it
is affixed to the harpoon line used for large marine mammals, such as
the white whale and the larger species of seals. This float not only
retards the flight of the speared animal, but it serves to mark the spot
where it sinks, for at certain seasons the seals sink as soon as they
die. A&nbsp;speared animal always sinks more quickly than one shot dead
with a ball, probably because its struggles are more prolonged in the
first instance and exhaustion of breath is more complete.</p>

<p>The hair of the animal whose skin is intended for a float is
sometimes scraped off before the skin is removed from the body,
otherwise it may be left until the skin is partly dry and then be shaved
off. The manner of loosening the hair is similar to that used by
butchers of hogs, only that the boiling water is poured on and a small
patch of hair pulled off at a time, instead of submerging the entire
animal. The hair from the green skin must be carefully pulled out or
else the black scurf adhering will be detached and thus render the skin
less nearly waterproof.</p>

<p>The skins or bags used for holding oil and fat are prepared in a
similar
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page249" id =
"page249">249</a></span>
manner, excepting that the hair is left on the skin and the hairy side
left within. The oil and fat are put in the skin at the posterior end
and it is then tied up like a float. The largest sealskins are used for
oilbags, and may contain as much as 300 pounds of fat or oil.</p>

<p>When a sack of oil is sold the bag is usually returned to the seller,
who again fills it with oil or converts the skin into bootlegs or soles.
The leather having become thoroughly impregnated with the oil makes the
best for wear, often resisting moisture for three or four days of
continuous wet.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of weapons and their accessories,
I&nbsp;may mention No. 3069, a&nbsp;small pouch made of thick sealskin.
The shape is somewhat like that of a leg of mutton. This is used for
carrying gun caps. The neck is only large enough to permit one cap to
fall out at a time.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_hunting" id = "kokso_hunting">HUNTING.</a></h5>

<p>I have already referred briefly to the various methods of taking
seals, white whales, and other game, while describing the boats, spears,
and other apparatus used in their pursuit.</p>

<p>The most important hunt of the year, however, comes in the autumn,
when the reindeer are migrating in large herds and crossing the rivers.
The deer are wanted now for their flesh for food and their skins for
clothing. Everything necessary for the chase is taken in the umiak, or,
perhaps, a&nbsp;whaleboat, to a locality convenient to where the animals
cross over. Here the tent is pitched, and a camp is made. The hunters
scour the neighboring land for herds of reindeer, which are seen running
about under the impulse to seek the opposite sex. As they arrive from
different directions, those of one sex must cross the river. Since the
females furnish the lighter skins for clothing, and the males the
greater amount of meat and a heavier skin for various purposes, deer of
both sexes are equally useful.</p>

<p>A band of three or four, or as many as a hundred, may be sighted
slowly winding their way through the openings of the timbered areas on
the opposite side of the river. The native with telescope, or binocular
in focus, observes their movements until they pause a moment on the bank
and then plunge quickly into the water, where they keep well together
until the opposite shore is reached. Here, if undisturbed, they will
stand to allow the water to drip from their bodies, and then will walk
slowly along to a convenient place to climb the bank and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page250" id =
"page250">250</a></span>
penetrate the strip of woods or bushes and emerge into the open country
beyond. As soon as the native sees the deer everything is put in
readiness on the kaiak, and with quick strokes of the double-bladed
paddle he is behind and below the now terrified animals. They rear and
plunge in frantic confusion, endeavoring to escape their most dreaded
foe. The hunter calmly drives the herd through the water as the shepherd
does his flock on land. Those disposed to break away are rounded up and
driven back. The greatest care must be exercised not to let the animals
get below the kaiak, or they will swim faster with the stream than the
hunter can paddle. As there are, generally, two or more kaiaks, it is an
easy matter for the men to drive the animals wherever they desire. When
the camp is above, the deer are driven diagonally across so as to make
them come out near the camp. If the site is below, the animals are
allowed to drop down to a convenient place. These maneuvers depend on
the wind, as the sense of smell of the deer is very acute at this
season, and the scent of the camp, if detected, would throw the animals
into such terror that the greater number would escape.</p>

<p>When near the place the hunter takes his deer spear, which is exactly
like the one used by the Indians, and quietly stabs the animal in a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page251" id =
"page251">251</a></span>
vital spot, endeavoring so to wound the beast that it will have only
enough strength to enable it to attain the shallow water or shore, and
not to wander off. Among the hundreds of times I have had the
opportunity to witness this, I&nbsp;never knew a deer wounded with the
spear to turn back to swim in the direction from which it came. They
appear to dread the water, and strive most frantically to regain the
land where, if mortally wounded, they stand; the limbs gradually
diverging to sustain their trembling body; the eyes gazing piteously at
the foe, who often mocks their dying struggles, or pitches a stone at
their quivering legs to make them fall. A&nbsp;convulsive struggle as
the blood fills the internal cavity, a&nbsp;sudden pitch, and the life
is gone without sigh or groan. As many of the herd as can be speared are
quickly dispatched and the entire number secured if possible. It is
supposed that the ones which return to the shore whence they came give
the alarm and frighten other arrivals away from the starting point. The
hunters strive to prevent their return, and will often allow two, near
the camp, to escape in order to pursue the retreating animal.</p>

<p>Those which have been killed and are lying in the water are dragged
on land and skinned. The pelt is taken off as that of a beef is when
skinned by a butcher. The ears and the skin of the head are left on. The
body is opened and the viscera are removed. The intestines are freed
from the fat; the stomach is cleansed of the greater portion of its
contents, and the blood which collected within the cavity is scooped up
with the hands and ladled into that receptacle; and both are reserved
for food. The heart and liver are taken to the camp, where they help to
form a variety in the animal food of these people. Other portions of the
flesh are also consumed. The sinew, which lies along the lumbar region
just below the superficial muscles, is exposed by a cut, and with the
point of a knife or tip of the finger loosened from its adherent flesh.
One end, usually the forward end, is detached and a stout thong tied to
it, and it is jerked from its attachment by a vigorous pull. It requires
a strong person to remove this tendon from the body of a lean animal.
A&nbsp;stroke of the knife frees the wide layer of sinew from blood and
particles of flesh. This is now laid aside for awhile, then washed to
free it from the blood, which would stain it dark in color and also tend
to diminish the strength of the fibers by rotting them. It is now spread
out and allowed to dry. The body is cut across the small of the back and
laid aside. The head is severed from the neck and discarded if there be
no portion of the horns which is needed to serve some purpose, such as a
handle for a knife or other tool. If the head be that of a young deer it
is often taken to the camp and put into a pot and boiled in the
condition in which it comes from the field. When cooked for a long time
it becomes very soft; the muscles of the jaw being reduced to a
semigelatinous condition, which makes an excellent article of food.</p>

<p>The tongue is invariably taken out entire, and is considered the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page252" id =
"page252">252</a></span>
greatest delicacy, either frozen, raw or cooked, or dried and smoked. In
fact a tongue from the reindeer is good at any time or condition.</p>

<p>The hindquarters are seldom separated, but are placed within the
thoracic cavity, and either cached near the scene of slaughter or placed
on the kaiak and taken to a spot where others are deposited from which
supplies may be taken when the food for the winter is required.</p>

<p>Here and there along the bank will be placed the body of a single
deer, sometimes two or three, which have been killed too far from the
present camp for the hunter to bring them home. These spots are marked
or remembered by some visible surrounding, lest the deep snows of winter
obscure the locality, and often the place can not be found when wanted.
The cache in which the flesh is deposited is simply a few stones or
bowlders laid on the ground and the meat put upon them. A&nbsp;rude sort
of wall is made by piling stones upon the meat until it is hidden from
the ravages of ravens, gulls, foxes, wolves and the detested
wolverine.</p>

<p>As soon as the hunter considers that the deer of that particular
locality have ceased to cross, he will repair to another station and go
through the same process. The deer which are first slain, when the
hunting season arrives, and the weather is still so warm that the flies
and decomposition ruin the meat, are reserved for supplies of dog
food.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_misc" id = "kokso_misc">
MISCELLANEOUS IMPLEMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>I have already, in the earlier pages of this paper, referred to
various tools and implements.</p>

<p>In addition to these, the Koksoagmyut have comparatively few
tools.</p>

<p>In former ages stone and ivory were fashioned into crude implements
for the purposes which are now better and more quickly served by
instruments of iron or steel.</p>

<p>These people have now been so long in more or less direct contact
with traders who have supplied them with these necessaries that it is
rare to find one of the knives used in former times. Certain operations,
however, are even to this day better performed with a knife made of
ivory. The ice from the kaiak bottom or the sides of the boat may best
be removed by means of an ivory knife, resembling a snow knife but
shorter. The steel knife is always kept sharp and if so used would, on
the unyielding, frozen skin-covering of those vessels, quickly cut a
hole. The Eskimo living remote from the trading stations use a snow
knife made from the tusk of a walrus or the main stem of the reindeer
antler.</p>

<p>That steel or iron is deemed an improvement on the former materials
from which cutting instruments were made is shown by the crude means now
employed. If the person has not a knife an unused spearhead, having an
iron point, is often employed instead for skinning animals and dressing
the skins.</p>

<p>Stone heads for weapons of all kinds have been discarded. Ivory
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page253" id =
"page253">253</a></span>
spears are at times used but these only when the hunter is close to the
prey.</p>

<p>Some of the men have acquired considerable skill in fashioning iron
into the required shape. They eagerly stand around anyone who may be at
work, and evince the greatest curiosity in anything new.</p>

</div>

<p>The collection contains two of the snow knives referred to above. No.
3067 is a large snow knife, made from the lower portion of the main stem
of the horn of the male reindeer. It is simply half of the split horn
with the middle scooped out. The length is 12 inches. This form of
instrument is used more especially to smooth down the inequalities of
the blocks of snow after being placed in position. No. 3140
(Fig.&nbsp;70) is a large snow knife made of walrus ivory. It is 13
inches long and nearly 2 inches wide for the greater part of the blade,
which terminates in a rounded point. The instrument has two edges, and
in general appearances resembles a double-edged Roman sword. The handle
is cut to fit to the hand.</p>

<p>Among other peculiar implements collected is one represented in Fig.
71 (No.&nbsp;3555), which is a “back-scratcher.” This instrument
consists of a shaft made from a limb of a larch tree. It is 17 inches
long and about three-fourths of an inch through, flattened to less than
half an inch and tapering toward the end to be held in the hand. On the
lower end is a dish-shaped piece of <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘reinder’">reindeer</ins> horn, two and one-eighth inches
long and seven-eighths of an inch wide. Through the center of the piece
of horn an oblong hole has been cut for the insertion of the shaft or
handle. The edges of the horn piece are sharp as can be made. This piece
is one-third of an inch thick, and having the sharp edge up is
convenient for thrusting down the back to scratch one’s self in places
where the hand could not reach on account of thick deerskin clothing.
The Eskimo name of the instrument is ku-mé-u-tîk, or that which removes
lice.</p>

<p>The steel needles obtained from the traders are kept in a little
ivory receptacle of various shapes, two of which are shown in Figs. 72
and 73.</p>

<p>This is hollow and filled with any sphagnum moss. One end is
permanently closed by a wooden or ivory plug, held in by little pegs.
The plug in the other end is easily taken out. The needle case is
usually
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page254" id =

pierced to receive a loop by which it may be hung to the belt or the

<p>Needles are also kept in a kind of small cushion (Fig. 74) made of
sealskin, elaborately ornamented with beads and stuffed with sphagnum
moss. The cushion is perforated around the edge to receive the needles,
which would not easily go through the tough skin.</p>

<p>Accompanying one of these needle cushions in the collection is one of
the old-fashioned thimbles such as are still used, although metal
thimbles are preferred. It is simply a strip of sealskin sewed into a
ring large enough to fit the forefinger, and is usually attached to the
needle cushion by a thong with an ivory toggle on the end, to prevent
the thimble from slipping off.</p>

<p>Small articles used in sewing, such as scraps of skin, needle cases,
sinew thread, thimbles, etc., are carried in small bags of deerskin,
which are often elaborately ornamented with beads of various colors,
like the specimen in the collection, No. 3047.</p>


<h5><a name = "kokso_amuse" id = "kokso_amuse">
AMUSEMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that these people have had their lot cast
upon the frozen shores of the sea, they appear happy and contented and
loath to leave the land of their birth. Although it is a constant
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page255" id =
"page255">255</a></span>
struggle amidst the terrible storms of a region where for eight months
in the year the soil is frozen and the few warm days of summer bring
forth a scanty vegetation, yet so strong is their love for these
inhospitable shores that the absent pine for a return and soon lose
their hold on life if they are not able to do so.</p>

<p>During the intervals between the hunts and when food is still
plentiful, the Eskimo, divert themselves with games of various kinds of
their own. They are also quick to adopt other games which require
outdoor exercise.</p>

<p>Football calls out everybody, from the aged and bent mother of a
numerous family to the toddling youngster scarcely able to do more than
waddle under the burden of his heavy deerskin clothes. Wrestling among
the men is indulged in for hours at a time. The opponents remove all
their superfluous garments, seize each other around the waist and lock
hands behind each other’s backs. The feet are spread widely apart and
each endeavors to draw, by the strength of the arms alone, the back of
his opponent into a curve and thus bring him off his feet. Then with a
lift he is quickly thrown flat on his back. The fall must be such that
the head touches the ground. Where the contestants are nearly matched
the struggle may continue so long that one of them gives up from
exhaustion. The feet are never used for tripping. Such a procedure would
soon cause the witnesses to stop the struggle.</p>

<p>The Eskimo and Indians often engage in comparative tests of their
strength in wrestling. The Eskimo prove the better men in these
engagements. Throwing stones at a mark is a sport for the younger men,
some of whom acquire surprising dexterity.</p>

<p>If a pack of playing-cards can be obtained they engage in games which
they have learned from the white people and teach each other. Small
stakes are laid on the result of the game. The women appear to exhibit a
greater passion for gambling than the men do. They will wager the last
article of clothing on their persons till the loser appears in a nude
condition before spectators. Then the winner will usually return at
least a part of the clothing, with an injunction to play more and lose
less.</p>

<p>The young girls often play the game of taking an object and secreting
it within the closed hand. Another is called upon to guess the contents.
She makes inquiries as to the size, color, etc., of the object. From the
answers she gradually guesses what the thing is.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;Cup and
ball.<br>Koksoagmyut.</p>
</div>

<p>A favorite game, something like cup and ball, is played with the
following implements: A&nbsp;piece of ivory is shaped into the form of
an elongate cone and has two deep notches or steps cut from one side
(Fig.&nbsp;75). In the one next the base are bored a number of small
holes and one or two holes in the upper step. The apex has a single
hole. On the opposite side of the base two holes are made obliquely,
that they will meet, and through them is threaded a short piece of
thong. To the other end of the thong is attached a peg of ivory, about 4
inches
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page256" id =
"page256">256</a></span>
long. The game is that the person holding the plaything shall, by a
dextrous swing of the ball, catch it upon the ivory peg held in the
hand. The person engages to catch it a certain number of times in
succession, and on failure to do so allows the opponent to try her
skill. The skull of a hare is often substituted for the ivory “ball,”
and a few perforations are made in the walls of the skull to receive the
peg. It requires a great amount of practice to catch the ball, as the
string is so short that one must be quick to thrust the peg in before it
describes the part of a small circle.</p>

<p>The children sometimes use a stick or other sharp-pointed instrument
to make a series of straight lines in the newly fallen snow and at the
same time repeat certain gibberish. This was at first very confusing to
me, but a woman repeated the words and I guessed from her description
where the idea sprang from.</p>

<p>These people had heard of the teachings of the Labrador missionaries
(Moravians), all of whom are Germans, and as the Eskimo of that coast
use the German numerals in preference to their own, the natives of that
region have at some time repeated the names of those numerals to certain
of the Hudson strait people and they have taught each other.</p>

<p>The names of the German numerals as sounded by the Koksoagmyut are as
follows. The numbers are one to fifteen, consecutively:</p>

<p>Ái i; chu vái i; ta lái i; pi û´ la; pi li pi; tsék si; tsé pa; ák

Koksoagmyut.</p>
</div>

<p>I have already referred to the game of football as played by these
people.</p>

<p>Fig. 76 represents the football (No. 3070) and the whip for driving
it. The Eskimo are very fond of this game. All the people of every age,
from the toddling infant to the aged female with bended back, love
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page257" id =
"page257">257</a></span>
to urge the aí&nbsp;uk&nbsp;toúk, as the ball is termed. The size of the
ball varies from 3 to 7 inches in diameter. They have not yet arrived at
perfection in making a spherical form for the ball, but it is often an
apple shape. It is made by taking a piece of buckskin, or sealskin, and
cutting it into a circular form, then gathering the edges and stuffing
the cavity with dry moss or feathers. A&nbsp;circular piece of skin is
then inserted to fill the space which is left by the incomplete
gatherings. This ball is very light and is driven either by a blow from
the foot or else by a whip of peculiar construction. This whip consists
of a handle of wood 8 to 12 inches in length. To prevent it from
slipping out of the hand when the blow is struck, a&nbsp;stout thong of
sealskin is made into the form of a long loop which is passed over the
hand and tightens around the wrist. To the farther end of the whip
handle are attached a number of stout thongs of heavy sealskin. These
thongs have their ends tied around the handle and thus form a number of
loops of 12 to 20 inches in length. These are then tied together at the
bottom in order to give them greater weight when the ball is struck by
them. A&nbsp;lusty Eskimo will often send the ball over a hundred yards
through the air with such force as to knock a person down.</p>

<p>At Fort Chimo the game is played during the late winter afternoons
when the temperature is 30° or 40° below zero. It is exciting and
vigorous play where a large crowd joins in the game.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ball is in the form of two irregular hemispheres joined
together, making a sphere which can be rolled only in a certain
direction. It is very awkward and produces much confusion by its erratic
course. Nos. 3461, 3287, and 3460 are footballs of the pattern first
described.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Dominoes. Hudson Strait
Eskimo.</p>

<p>The Innuit who come from the western end of Hudson strait, the
so-called “Northerners,” have a game which they play with sets of pieces
of ivory cut into irregular shapes, and marked on one face with spots
arranged in different patterns (Fig.&nbsp;77). The number of pieces in a
set varies from 60 to 148. The name of the set is
Á&nbsp;ma&nbsp;zu´&nbsp;a&nbsp;lát, and somewhat resembles our game of
dominoes.</p>

<p>The game is played in the following manner: Two or more persons,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page258" id =
"page258">258</a></span>
according to the number of pieces in the set, sit down and pile the
pieces before them. One of the players mixes the pieces together in
plain view of the others. When this is done he calls them to take the
pieces. Each person endeavors to obtain a half or third of the number if
there be two or three players. The one who mixed up the pieces lays down
a piece and calls his opponent to match it with a piece having a similar
design. If this can not be done by any of the players the first has to
match it and the game continues until one of the persons has exhausted

northern Eskimo stake the last article they possess on the issue of the

relinquished to the victor. I&nbsp;have heard that the wives so disposed
of often sit down and win themselves back to their former owners.</p>

<p>The only musical instrument which I observed among these people

was a violin of their own manufacture, made, of course, in imitation of
those they had seen used by the whites. Its form is sufficiently well
shown by the figure (Fig.&nbsp;82), and is made of birch, or spruce, and
the two strings are of coarse, loosely twisted sinew. The bow has a
strip of whalebone in place of horsehair, and is resined with spruce
gum. This fiddle is held across the lap when played.</p>

ART.</a></h5>

<p>Art is but slightly developed among these people. Their weapons and
other implements are never adorned with carvings of animals and other
natural objects or with conventional patterns, as is the case in so
great a degree among the Eskimo of Alaska. They are, however, not devoid
of artistic skill, as is shown by the good taste often exhibited in the
trimming of their garments, and also by the dolls, which I have already
referred to and figured.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page260" id =

<p>The collection also contains several small ivory carvings, which
possess considerable artistic merit. Among these, the small objects,
(Fig.&nbsp;83), collected from the so-called Northerners, represent
various waterfowl cut from pieces of walrus ivory. The various species
thus carved are loons, ducks, geese, sea pigeons, and murres. One
represents a female eider with two young mounted upon her back. It is
readily discerned, in most instances, what position and action of the
bird was intended to be represented. The last shows in the plainest
possible manner that the loon is just starting to swim from an object
which has given it alarm.</p>

STORY-TELLING AND FOLK LORE.</a></h5>

<p>Like all other Eskimo, the Koksoagmyut are exceedingly fond of
story-telling. Sitting in the hut, engaged in their evening work, the
old men tell what they have seen and heard. The old women relate the
history of the people of former days, depending entirely on memory,
often interspersed with recitations apparently foreign to the thread of
the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page261" id =

legend. The younger members sit with staring eyes and countenances which
show their wondering interest in the narration. Far into the night the
droning tone of her voice continues reciting the events of the past
until one by one the listeners drowsily drop to sleep in the position
they last assumed.</p>

<p>I was fortunately able to collect a number of these ancient legendary
stories, some of them of considerable length.</p>

The Coming of the White People.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The Eskimo were on the verge of starvation and had eaten nearly all
their food. They saw that in a few more days death would come. The
greatest Tungaksoak or great Tung&nbsp;ak determined to bring relief and
prophesied that people having light hair and white skins would come in
an immense úmiak. He placed a young puppy on a chip and another on an
old sealskin boot, and set them adrift on the water. The puppies drifted
in different directions, and in the course of time the one on the chip
returned and brought with it the Indians. A&nbsp;long time after that,
when the people had nearly forgotten the other puppy, a&nbsp;strange
white object like an iceberg came directly toward the shore. In a few
moments the puppy, now a man, announced that the people had come with
many curious things in their vessel. The man immediately became a
dog.</p>

Origin of living things on the earth and in the water.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A long time ago a man who was cutting down a tree observed that the
chips continued in motion as they fell from the blows. Those that fell
into the water became the inhabitants of the water. Those that fell on
the land became the various animals and in time were made the food of
mankind. (This was the version given me by a person living at Fort
Chimo.) Another person from farther west gave the following account of
the origin of the living things of the earth: Previous to a time when
water covered the earth the people lived on such food as they could
always find prepared for them in abundance. They did not know of any
animals at that time on the land or in the water. The water finally went
away and the seaweeds became trees, shrubs, bushes, and grass. The long
seaweeds were the trees and the smaller kinds became the bushes and
grass. The grass, however, was in some manner put in various places by a
walrus at a later date than the appearance of the trees.</p>

<p>A woman who had lost her husband lived among strangers. As they
desired to change the place of their habitation, they resolved to
journey to another point of land at a distance. The woman who was
depending on charity had become a burden of which they wished to rid
themselves.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page262" id =
"page262">262</a></span>
So they put all their belongings into the umiak and when they were on
the way they seized the woman and cast her overboard. She struggled to
regain the side of the boat, and when she seized it, the others cut off
her fingers which fell into the water and changed to seals, walrus,
whales, and white bears. The woman in her despair, screamed her
determination to have revenge for the cruelty perpetrated upon her. The
thumb became a walrus, the first finger a seal, and the middle finger a
white bear. When the former two animals see a man they try to escape
lest they be served as the woman was.</p>

<p>The white bear lives both on the land and in the sea, but when he
perceives a man revengeful feelings fill him, and he determines to
destroy the person who he thinks mutilated the woman from whose finger
he sprang.</p>

Origin of the guillemots.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>While some children were playing on the level top of a high cliff
overhanging the sea, the older children watched the younger ones lest
they should fall down the bluff. Below them the sea was covered with
ice, and the strip along the shore had not yet loosened to permit the
seals to approach. Soon afterward a wide crack opened and the water was
filled with seals, but the children did not observe them. The wind was
cold, and the children romped in high glee, encouraging each other to
greater exertion in their sports and shouted at the top of their voices.
The men saw the seals and hastened to the shore to put their kaiaks into
the water to pursue them. At this the children increased their shouts,
which frightened the seals till they dived out of sight. One of the men
was angry, and exclaimed to the others, “I&nbsp;wish the cliff would
topple over and bury those noisy children for scaring the seals.” In a
moment the cliff tipped over and the poor children fell among the
fragments of huge rocks and stones at the bottom. Here they were changed
into guillemots or sea-pigeons, with red feet, and even to this day they
thus dwell among the débris at the foot of cliffs next to the water of
the sea.</p>

used the word so often that they told him to get it himself. He hurried
so much that he was changed into a raven, and now uses that sound for

directed to go over the place, and they promised to wait for her on the

giving the direction, became indistinct. The poor woman became confused
and suspected they wanted to desert her. She remained about the cliff,

off on a hunt, but secreted himself so as to observe the entrance of
anything into the house. After a while he saw a fox enter. He suspected
that the fox was after food. He quietly slipped up to the house and on
entering saw a most beautiful woman dressed in skin clothing of wondrous

Story of the orphan boy.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A small boy, who had neither father, mother, nor any living
relatives, was dwelling with some people who maltreated him in every way
their fancy could suggest. He was kept in the entry way to the hut, like
a dog, and was permitted to eat only of the skin of walrus when they had
it to give him. At other times they would throw to him what they
themselves would not eat. They forbade him to have a knife with which to
cut his food, and he was compelled to gnaw the bones like a dog.
A&nbsp;little girl, the daughter of the head of the family with whom he
lived, would secretly take to him a knife with which to divide the tough
skin of the walrus. She also carried food of better quality to him when
she could do so clandestinely. These kind attentions pleased him very
much, and made him long for an opportunity to escape. But how was he to
better his condition when the hand of everybody was raised against him
on account of his treatment at home? The little girl who had so often
befriended him could not assist him to escape from such a life. He
endeavored to lay a plan, but it came to naught. There seemed no help
for him. One night he abandoned all hope and threw himself on the ground
in despair. While there he gazed at the bright moon, and the more
intently his gaze was fixed upon it the more he thought he discerned the
face of a man in it, and at last he cried to the man to come and help
him escape from his miserable life. The man came down from the moon and
gave the poor boy a frightful beating, but the more he was beaten the
larger he seemed to grow. After a while he became so strong that he
could handle a large rock as easily as he had hitherto handled a little
stone. A&nbsp;large, round bowlder from the beach was no more to him
than a bullet held in the hand of a strong man.</p>

<p>The moon man then told the boy that he was large enough to take care
of himself and do as he pleased with the people who had treated him so
badly. With this the two parted, and the moon man went to his hole in
the sky, while the boy walked along the beach picking up
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page266" id =
"page266">266</a></span>
rocks and tossing them along the shore until the character of the
water’s edge was entirely changed. When the boy arrived at the hut it
was daylight, for he had tarried so long on the beach testing his
strength that the night had slipped away.</p>

<p>The people were terrified when they saw to what enormous proportions
the abused boy had grown. He became frenzied the instant he saw his
former persecutors, and seizing first one and then the other in his
hands dashed them against the rocks. The blood and brains ran in
streams. One of the men, seeing his doom, begged for his life and
promised his kaiak, spears, sled, and wife if he should be spared. The
enraged boy continued the slaughter until only the little girl who had
so often befriended him was left. She became his wife, and in the course
of a few hours the man, whose name was Kou jé yuk; became of a natural
size again and passed his life in comfort.</p>

<p>This story was obtained from a man from Labrador. The Eskimo assert
that this occurred near Ohak (often pronounced Okak), now a missionary
station. They show the rock, which a little imagination gives the
appearance of having dried blood and brains still upon it.</p>

say that they are able to call the aurora and converse with it. They
send messages to the dead through these spirits.</p>

The sky.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>The sky is supposed to be an immense dome, of hard material, reared
over the earth, long from east to west and shorter from north to south.
The edges of the land and sea are bounded by high, precipitous sides,
shelving outward or sloping inward to prevent anything
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page267" id =

living on the earth from going to the region beyond. There is the source
of light and heat. The dome of the sky is very cold, and at times
covered with crystals of frost which fall in the form of snow or frost
films to the earth, and then the sky becomes clear. The clouds are
supposed to be large bags of water, controlled by two old women who run
with them across the sky, and as the water escapes from the seams it
falls in the form of rain to the earth. The thunder is their voice and
the lightning is their torch. If a spark falls from this on anyone he
dies and goes to the region above.</p>

<h4><a name = "nenenot" id = "nenenot">
THE NENENOT OR “NASKOPIE.”</a></h4>

<p>The Indians of the Ungava district are locally known as Naskopie,
a&nbsp;term of reproach applied to them by the mountaineers (the
Montagnais of the early Jesuit missionaries) during the earlier days
when the former acted falsely in one of their concerted struggles with
the Eskimo of the eastern coast.</p>

<p>The name given to themselves is Nenenot, a word meaning true, or
ideal red men. To the west of these people dwell a branch of the tribe
along the east shore of Hudson bay. To the southeast dwell the
mountaineers.</p>

<p>The western people differ greatly in customs and many words of their
language from the Nenenots. The mountaineers differ but little in their
customs, and only in speech as much as would be expected from the
different locality in which they dwell.</p>

<p>These three tribes have distinct boundaries, beyond which they seldom
wander. Of late years, however, a&nbsp;gradual influx of the western
people has poured into the Ungava district, due to the decrease of the
food supply along that portion of the eastern coast of Hudson bay.</p>

<p>The Nenenots appear, from the best information I could obtain on the
subject, to have been driven to their present location during the wars
waged against them by the Iroquois in times long gone by and remembered
only in tradition.</p>

<p>They assert that their original home was in a country to the west,
north of an immense river, and toward the east lay an enormous body of
salt water. The former was supposed to be the St. Lawrence river and the
latter to be Hudson bay. When they came to their present place they say
that they found Eskimo alone, and these only along the coast. They are a
branch of the Cree stock, as their language clearly indicates.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page268" id =
"page268">268</a></span>
<p>Many years ago war was waged upon them by the people whose name is
remembered with terror even to this day. Most cruel atrocities were
perpetrated, and in despair they fled from the land of their fathers,
where they had lived as a numerous people, and were pursued by their
merciless foes until but a remnant reached what is now known as the
“Height of Land.”</p>

<p>Being now driven to a strange land, where they found numerous Eskimo
on all sides, only a few years elapsed before they encroached too
greatly upon the land which the Eskimo had always held. Contention and
struggles arose, culminating in a disposition to fight, and in the
course of time desultory warfare, carried on by single combat or
organized raids. This lasted for many years, even after the advent of
the white men as traders along the coast. Some of the battles were
attended with great slaughter on both sides. The Eskimo seldom ventured
far from the coast on their raids, but fought bravely when attacked on
their own ground. In most instances they outwitted the Indians by
decoying them into ambush, and killing great numbers of them. Within the
present century they have been more peaceably disposed toward each
other. Since the arrival of the white men at various points along the
coast these troubles have ceased, and the Indians and Eskimo are now on
intimate terms; not that either party have any special regard for the
new comers, but they have a mutual fear of each other, and the white man
now engages their entire attention.</p>

<p>In the early struggles the Indian found the Eskimo to be a sturdy
opponent, possessed of greater endurance and perseverance than himself.
After the conclusion of the troubles they withdrew to their present
haunts, and now wander indiscriminately over the land, although the
Eskimo seldom ventures far into the interior unless it be along the
valley of some large stream. They even camp alongside of each other, and
aged Indian men and women, who have been left behind the parties of
young people who are in quest of fur-bearing animals during the winter
months, are only too glad to have a camp of jolly Eskimo near at hand.
With them they can live as parasites until their hosts are exhausted of
supplies, or until they move to another locality to relieve themselves
of the importunities of their unbidden guests.</p>

<p><a name = "nene_principal" id = "nene_principal">The Indian is
not</a> the physical superior of the Eskimo. It is true they are more
expert on snowshoes, because the snowshoes belong to their mode of life.
They are used by the Eskimo only when they can be purchased by barter
from the Indian. The Eskimo snowshoe is merely a rude imitation of the
form used by the neighboring Indians. In the canoe the Indian is at
home; so also is the Eskimo in the kaiak, which braves the severest
weather and the roughest water, on which the Indian would only gaze in
dread and never venture.</p>

<p>Ability to endure fatigue is less in the Indian than the Eskimo, who
accomplishes by patient persistence what the Indian desires to do in a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page269" id =
"page269">269</a></span>
hurry. I&nbsp;have not observed Indians carry such heavy loads as those
borne on the shoulders of Eskimo, who, with ease, ascended a hill of
such abrupt steepness that an unencumbered person climbed it with
difficulty. Several Eskimo men ascended this hill, each with a barrel of
flour on his shoulders.</p>

<p>The Indian is able to withstand the effect of cold as well as the
Eskimo. The clothing of the latter is certainly better adapted to
protect against cold. In times of scarcity of food the Eskimo is able to
go without food for a number of days and yet perform a considerable
amount of physical labor, while the Indian would require food on the
second or third day, and refuse to move until it had been furnished.</p>

<p>In comparison with a white man under the same conditions the natives
of either class would soon show signs of inferiority, and under
prolonged exertion but few, even of the Eskimo, would endure the strain.
The principal strength of these people is shown in their success in the
chase.</p>

<p>The children are obedient to their parents, who seldom ever chastise
them. Disrespect to parents is unknown, and in their intercourse with
each other there are no clashings during youth. Not until the jealousies
awakened under the stimulus of their sexual instincts arouse their
passions do they begin to show enmity and hatred toward each other.</p>

<p>The males evidently exhibit jealousy to a less degree than the
opposite sex. The men, after a protracted absence from each other, often
embrace and shed tears of joy at meeting. The women are less
demonstrative.</p>

<p>The number of children born exceeds the number of deaths. Mortality
appeared to be low for the two years I was near these people. The
prevailing diseases are of the lungs and bowels. The lung diseases are
induced by constant exposure to extremes of wet and cold and the
inhalation of foul air laden with terebinthine odors, arising from the
resinous woods used for fuel. Changes of the wind blowing in at the door
cause the interior to become filled with smoke, which is endured rather
than admit the cold air from without.</p>

<p>Abstinence from fresh food for a long time, with dry meat only to
subsist upon, is often broken by the sudden capture of deer. This
affords an opportunity for gorging until the digestive organs are
weakened and serious complications arise. It is quite probable that
gluttony directly produces half of the illnesses that occur among these
people. The insufficiency of clothing does not apparently influence
health, as they seem utterly regardless of exposure, and long continued
dwelling in the tents probably induces nearly, if not quite, all the
other ills afflicting them. Indolent ulcers and scrofulous complications
are frequent, but only in few instances are of such character as to
prevent their following their usual occupations. During illness they are
stolid, and appear to suffer intense pain without the twitching of a
muscle. When
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page270" id =
"page270">270</a></span>
death approaches it has but little terror, and is awaited with
indifference.</p>

<p>The remedies employed are only those afforded by the beating of the
drum and the mumblings of the shaman, who claims to have control of the
spirit which causes all disease and death. They are, however, firm
believers in the efficacy of potions compounded by the white trader, who
is fully as ignorant of the disease as the subject himself is. Often a
harmless mixture of red ink, red pepper, ginger, or other pungent
substance is given, with a multiplicity of confusing directions,
bewildering the messenger dispatched for relief, who, in repeating them,
often makes mistakes and advises that the whole quantity be swallowed.
The effect is sometimes magical, and the patient recovers. Powders are
rubbed over the seat of pain and liniments swallowed with avidity.
Strange as it may seem, they often report good effects, and rarely fail
to ask for more of the same kind. Both sexes attain a great age&mdash;in
some instances certainly living over seventy years. Some assert that
they were well advanced in years before the white men came in 1827.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony is simply a consent to live together, obtained
by request if possible, and by force, if necessary. The man takes a wife
as soon as he considers himself able to support one. When the ceremony
is to be undertaken the consent of the girl’s parents or nearest
relatives is sought, and by holding out tempting inducements in the form
of presents, the suitor wins them to his favor. The consent of the girl,
if she has not yet been married is, of course, granted, if she desires
to comply with the wishes of her relatives. If not, the prospective
husband is informed that they can do nothing to turn her heart. The
matter is understood, and in a short time she is taken forcibly to his
or his father’s tent. The tie binding the couple is very loose, and on
the least provocation may be dissolved by either party. Continence on
the part of either wife or husband is unusual, and only notorious
incontinence is sufficient to cause the offender to be put away. Their
sexual relations are very loose among themselves, but their immorality
is confined to their own people. To take a second, a&nbsp;third, or even
a fourth wife, is not uncommon, but the additional wives are taken
principally for the purpose of performing labor imposed by the energy of
a successful hunter. It is only the wealthy men who can afford a
plurality of wives. The several wives often dwell in the same tent, but
as jealousies frequently arise they resort to fighting among themselves
to settle their differences. The husband looks on calmly until matters
go too far. When he interferes the women are sure of being soundly
thrashed. A&nbsp;woman, however, often assails her husband, and in some
instances gives him an unmerciful pounding, much to the amusement of the
bystanders, who encourage her to do her best. The man is a subject for
ridicule for weeks afterwards. Either sex can endure being beaten, but
not being laughed at. They rarely forgive a white man who laughs at
their discomfiture. An amusing incident occurred within a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page271" id =
"page271">271</a></span>
stone’s throw of Fort Chimo. An Indian had his clothing stripped from
him by his enraged wife. She then tore the tent from the poles, leaving
him naked. She took their property to the canoe, which she paddled
several miles up the stream. He followed along the bank until she
relented, whereupon their former relations were resumed, as though
nothing had disturbed the harmony of their life. The man was so severely
plagued by his comrades that for many days he scarcely showed his head
out of the tent. Rivalry for the favor of a woman or man is occasionally
the source of serious affrays. An instance was related to me where two
men sought the hand of a woman, and to settle which should have her,
they determined to go in their canoes to the lake near by and fight with
their deer spears. One of the men was killed and the other thereupon
obtained the woman, who is now living.</p>

<p>The sexes have their special labors. Women perform the drudgery and
bring home the food slain by their husbands, fetching wood and water,
tanning the skins, and making them into clothing. The labor of erecting
the tents and hauling the sleds when on their journey during the winter
falls upon them, and, in fact, they perform the greater part of the
manual labor. They are considered inferior to the men, and in their
social life they soon show the effects of the hardships they
undergo.</p>

<p>The females arrive at puberty at the age of 14 or 15, and are taken
as wives at even an earlier age. So early are they taken in marriage
that before they are 30 years of age they often appear as though they
were 50. Some of them are hideously ugly, and are so begrimed with smoke
from the resinous wood used for fuel and with filth that it is purely
guesswork to even approximate their age. The women appear to be exempted
from the curse of Eve, and deliver their children with as little concern
as is exhibited among the brutes. The child is not allowed to receive
nourishment until the third day, and no water must touch its body. The
infant is swaddled in wrappings of skins and cloths. Sphagnum moss is
used next the body and changed every other day. They begin to walk at an
early age, and this is, doubtless, the principal cause of the bowing of
the legs so often observed. The girls are neglected and the boys given
every advantage. The latter soon discover their importance and rarely
fail to show their domineering ways to the other sex.</p>

<p>It is quite rare that twins are born. It is not usual for a mother to
have more than four children, although as many as six or eight may be
born. As the paternal origin is often obscure, the person having that
woman as wife at the time of the child’s birth is supposed to be its
father.</p>

<p>The mortuary customs of the Naskopie were but imperfectly learned,
for when a death occurred at the trading station the body was buried
like a white man’s. A&nbsp;shallow grave was dug in a sandy soil, as
this offered less trouble in digging, and the body placed in a rudely
constructed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page272" id =
"page272">272</a></span>
coffin and covered with dirt. A&nbsp;small branch from a tree was placed
at the head of the grave, but with what signification I could not
satisfactorily determine. I&nbsp;received the reply that the white men
put something at the head of their graves, and so do the Indians.</p>

<p>Away from the post the Indians suspend their dead from the branches
of trees, if the ground be frozen too hard to excavate, and endeavor to
return in the following summer and inter the body. A&nbsp;person who has
distinguished himself among the people is often buried where the fire
has been long continued within the tent and thawed the ground to a
sufficient depth to cover the body. The tent is then removed to another
location. The Indians have not that dread of a corpse which is shown so
plainly among the Eskimo. The former have been known to strip the
clothing from recently deceased Eskimo, and it is not infrequent for
them to appropriate the gun or other implement placed by the side of a
dead Innuit.</p>

<p>In response to my inquiry how they disposed of their dead in former
ages, I&nbsp;obtained evidence that scaffold burial and suspension from
trees were formerly practiced and that subterranean burials were
introduced by the missionaries.</p>

<p>The dead are mourned for according to the position they occupied in
life, a&nbsp;favorite child often causing an alarming grief in the
mother who mourns for many days, constantly bemoaning her loss and
reminding the listeners of the traits in the child’s nature so well
remembered. The body is taken to the place of final rest by the friends,
the relations seldom accompanying it.</p>

<p>The life of these people is a constant struggle to obtain food and
raiment. Nothing, however unimportant, is done without much <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘delibation’">deliberation</ins> and
repeated consultation with friends.</p>

<p>They are also guided to a great extent by their dreams, for they
imagine that in the night they are in direct communication with the
spirits which watch over their daily occupations. Certain persons obtain
much renown in divining the dreams and these are consulted with the
greatest confidence. The drum is brought into use, and during its tumult
the person passes into a state of stupor or trance and in a few moments
arouses himself to reveal the meaning of the other’s dream.</p>

<p>Superstition holds these people in its terrible sway and everything
not understood is attributed to the working of one of the numerous
spirits.</p>

<p>Every object, however simple, appears to have its patron spirit,
which, in order that it may perform its services for the welfare of the
people, must be propitiated with offerings most pleasing and acceptable
to it. The rule seems to be that all spirits are by nature bad, and must
be propitiated to secure their favor. Each person has a patron spirit,
and these must always be placated lest misfortune come. These spirits
assume an infinite variety of forms, and to know just what form it
assumed when it inflicted its baneful effects, the shamans or medicine
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page273" id =
"page273">273</a></span>
men must be consulted. These are supposed to be in direct contact with
such spirits. The spirit will appear only in the darkness of the
conjuring house, and then permit itself to be appeased by some atonement
made by the afflicted, which can be made known only through the shaman.
He alone indicates the coarse to be pursued, and his directions, to be
explicitly followed, are often so confusing and impossible that the
person fails to perform them. All these minor spirits are under the
control of a single great spirit having its dwelling in the sky,
a&nbsp;term as illimitable with those people as with ourselves.</p>

<p>Each animal has its protective spirit, which is inferior to those of
man. The soul, if such expression may be used, of all animals is
indestructible, and is capable of reappearing again and again as often
as the material form is destroyed. There are spirits of beasts, birds,
fishes, insects, and plants. Each of these has a home to which it
returns after death, which is simply a cessation of that period of its
material form, and each may be recalled at the will of the shaman. If an
animal be killed it does not decrease the number of that species, for it
still exists, although in a different form.</p>

<p>The Canada jay is supposed to inform the various animals of the
approach of Indians, and these rarely fail to kill the jay wherever
found.</p>

<p>A species of mouse is supposed to have such dread of man that it dies
the instant it wanders near the track of a person. They often find these
tiny creatures near the path, and believe them to be unable to cross
it.</p>

<p>As the dusk of eve draws near, the silent flitting of the common
short-eared owl (<i>Asio accipitrinus</i>), and the hawk owl (<i>Surnia
funeria</i>), attracted by the sounds of the camp, creates direst
confusion. The announcement of its presence causes the entire assemblage
of people to be alert and hastily suspend some unworn garment, that the
bird may perceive it and thus know that the people are not so poor in
their worldly possessions as the spirit Wiq´-ti-qu may think; as it only
annoys people who are too poor to have extra garments. As this
short-eared owl frequents only the lower lands, the Indians assert that
they are compelled to select the higher points of land as their camping
sites in order to escape from him.</p>

<p>The shaman, as I have already said, is believed to be able to control
all these different spirits by his magic art, and to foretell the
future, but he must be concealed from view while carrying on his
mysterious performances. Hence a special structure must be erected in
which the shaman goes through various contortions of body until in a
state of exhaustion and while in that weakened condition he fancies
these things which have such wonderful hold on the minds of the
people.</p>

<p>The tent (Fig. 85) is high and of small diameter. Every crack and
crevice in the tent is carefully closed to exclude even the least ray of
light.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Indian medicine
lodge.</p>

<p>When within it, the shaman begins his operations by groaning and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page274" id =
"page274">274</a></span>
gradually increasing the pitch of voice until his screeching can be
heard a great distance. The din of the drum adds confusion to the
ceremony. This goes on until the shaman announces the appearance of the
spirit with whom he desires to commune. He implores the spirit to grant
the request, and in the course of time informs the people outside that
he has succeeded in securing the services of the spirit. All within
becomes quiet and only whisperings are heard.</p>

<p>The spirit promises to fulfill the obligation he has undertaken, and
the conjuror throws over the tent and states the result of the
interview. This result is always favorable, as his reputation depends
upon its happening. Any untoward circumstance, such as a person turning
over a stone or breaking a twig from a bush while traveling, is
sufficient cause to break the spell, and the blame can be laid on the
shoulders of such an offender. If the request be not granted within the
stipulated time as announced by the shaman at the end of the ceremony,
some one is certain to have been the cause of displeasing the spirit,
who now withholds the favor until reparation for the offense is made.
The conjurer is not slow to make some one do penance while he himself is
gaining time, as he takes good care not to attempt anything out of
season.</p>

<p>When an Indian kills one of the larger and fiercer wild beasts it is
customary to reserve a portion of the skin or other part of the body as
a memento of the deed.</p>

<p>These mementos are sacredly kept to show the prowess of the hunter
and at the same time they serve as a token of the wealth procured by
bartering the pelt of the animal to the trader. The wolf, bear, and
wolverine are considered worthy of remembrance, and of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page275" id =
"page275">275</a></span>
first and last mentioned animals a claw or a tip of an ear may serve as
a souvenir.</p>

<p>The under lip of the bear (Fig. 86) is the portion preserved. The
skin is cut off and spread flat to dry. The flesh side of the skin is
painted with powdered hematite mixed with water or oil.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 86.</span>&mdash;Indian amulet of
bearskin.</p>

<p>The outer edges or lips are ornamented with a single row of
many-colored beads. At the apex or middle of the lip is attached a
pendant in the form of a fish. The fish is 3 or 4 inches long, made of
cloth and has a row of beads extending around the entire circumference
of the length of the body.</p>

<p>These mementos are procured with great difficulty from the hunter who
has risked his life in the struggles attending the capture of the
beasts, for the barren-ground bear of that region is not a timid
creature like the black bear; and unless the hunter is well prepared for
the animal he would do well to let it alone.</p>

<p>The occupations of the sexes are so numerous that a detailed account
alone would suffice, as the various seasons have their regular routine
labors besides those unexpectedly appearing. In the spring the Indians
of both sexes come to the post of Fort <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Chino’">Chimo</ins> to trade their winter’s hunt of
fur-bearing animals. About the middle of March word is brought that the
camp of old men and women with a number of children, left from the
parties scattered in all directions during the previous fall, are slowly
approaching the post. They come by easy stages, camping here and there
for a day or two, but striving to be near about the time that the
earlier parties come in to trade. These latter straggle along from the
middle of April to the last of May, those who had ascended the streams
to the headwaters often not arriving until after the breaking of the ice
in the river, which may be as late as the 15th of June. When they
collect at the post they have an opportunity to meet after a separation
of months and enjoy a period of rest. The trading of their furs and
other articles continues slowly until the parties have made their
selections of guns, ammunition, tobacco, and cloths, a&nbsp;quantity of
flour, biscuit, peas, beans, rice, and sugar. Molasses is purchased in
enormous quantities, a&nbsp;hogshead of 90 gallons sufficing for only
three or four days’ trade. Other articles of varied character, from
needles and beads to calico and cloth, are bought by the women.</p>

<p>The parties receive the allowance given in advance for the
prosecution
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page276" id =
"page276">276</a></span>
of the ensuing winter’s hunt, after which they are relied on to raft
down the supply of wood cut by the white men for the next winter’s
supply of fuel. This consumes the season until the middle of July.
Stragglers are out even later. The men, meantime, select the locality
where they will remain for the summer and fall. The winter is to be
occupied in getting furs. Each head of a party announces his intended
location and the parties gradually leave the post for their destination.
Some of the Indians in former years were employed to assist the salmon
fishing, but they proved to be unreliable, either through fear of the
turbulent waters of the Koksoak or inattention to their task. They were
easily allured from the nets by the appearance of any game, and as the
tides in that river do not wait even for an Indian, serious losses
resulted from carelessness. Hence their places in later years are filled
by Eskimo, who are better adapted to the work.</p>

<p>The various parties disperse in different directions in order that
the entire district may afford its products for their benefit. The
Indians know the habits of the animals in those regions so well that
they are sure, if they go to a particular locality, to find the game
they are in quest of.</p>

<p>The reindeer provides them with the greater part of their food and
the skins of these animals afford them clothing.</p>

<p>Although their food consists of reindeer, ptarmigan, fish, and other
game, the deer is their main reliance, and when without it, however
great the abundance of other food, they consider themselves
starving.</p>

<p>The deer are procured in several ways, the principal of which is by
the use of the lance or spear. In the months of September and October
they collect from various directions. During the spring the females had
repaired to the treeless hills and mountains of the Cape Chidley region
to bring forth their young on those elevations in early June or late
May. After the young have become of good size the mothers lead them to
certain localities whither the males, having gone in an opposite
direction, also return. They meet somewhere along the banks of the
Koksoak river, usually near the confluence of that river with the North
or Larch. While thousands of these animals are congregated on each bank
small herds are continually swimming back and forth, impelled by the
sexual instinct. The hair of the young animals is now in excellent
condition for making skin garments. The females are thin, not yet having
recovered from the exhaustion of furnishing food for their young and
material for the new set of antlers, which appear immediately after the
birth of the fawns. The skin is, however, in tolerable condition,
especially in late October. The back of the male is now covered with a
large mass of fat known as “back fat.” This deposit is about 1 to 1½
inches thick by 2 feet broad and 20 inches long. The males are full of
vigor and in the best possible condition at this season, as the antlers
have become dry and cease to draw upon the animal for material to supply
their immense growth.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page277" id =

<p>The hunting parties, always on the alert for the herds of deer which
are hastening to the assembling place, follow them up, and in the course
of time conjecture at what point they will congregate. Here they
establish camps and intercept the deer when crossing the streams. The
canoes are held in readiness, while the hunters scan the opposite
hillsides for deer filing along the narrow paths through the forests and
bushes towards the river bank. Arrived there, the deer, after a moment’s
pause, eagerly take to the water, boldly swimming as they quarter down
stream with the current. The animals swim high in the water, scarcely
more than a third of the body immersed. They move compactly, in a crowd,
their antlers appearing at a distance like the branches of a tree
floating with the current. The Indian crouches low and speeds for the
canoe. Silently it is pushed into the water, and two or three rowers
take their places within. Rapid but noiseless strokes given by sturdy
arms soon bring the boat below and to the rear of the body of deer, who
are now thrown into the greatest consternation as they perceive their
most dreaded foe suddenly by their side. The deer endeavor to retreat,
but the men are between them and the shore. The occupants of the canoe
now drive the deer quartering up stream and toward the shore where the
camp is situated. Should they, by some mistake on the part of the
hunters, start downstream, they are certain to be separated, and swim so
rapidly that unless there be two canoes they will, for the most part,
escape. If the herd is well kept together they may be driven at the will
of the pursuer. He strives to direct them to such spot that when the
thrust with the spear is given only sufficient vitality will be left to
enable the stricken animal to regain the shore. When the spear touches
the vital part, the animal plunges forward and the instrument is
withdrawn. A&nbsp;hurried thrust pierces another victim, until all the
herd, if small, may be slain. The wounded animal now feels the internal
cavity filling with blood, and seeks the nearest land whereon its ebbing
strength scarcely allows it to stand. A&nbsp;few wistful turns of the
head to the right or left, a&nbsp;sudden spreading of its limbs to
support the swaying body, a&nbsp;plunge forward&mdash;the convulsive
struggles that mark the end. If the band is large, some generally
escape. Some may be so wounded that they plunge into the bushes perhaps
but a few yards and there lie and die, furnishing food for the beasts
and birds of prey.</p>

<p>The carcases of the deer are stripped of skins and fat and the
viscera are removed. The fat is laid one side, that from the intestines
being also reserved for future rendering.</p>

<p>The skins are taken to the camps and piled up. Those which are not to
be tanned immediately are hung over poles to dry, the flesh side turned
upwards.</p>

<p>The meat is stripped from the bones and taken to the tents, where it
is exposed to the smoke and hot air over the fire and quickly dried.
Some of the Indians are so expert in stripping the flesh from the
skeleton
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page278" id =
"page278">278</a></span>
that the exact form or outlines of the animal are preserved in the
process of drying. The drying flesh acquires a very dark brown color
from the smoke and blood left within the tissues. Certain portions of
the dry meat, especially those from the flanks and abdominal walls, are
quite palatable; they are crisp, and have a rich nutty flavor. The
intercostal muscles are also choice portions, while some of the flesh
from the haunches is dry and nearly tasteless. The back fat is often
dried and smoked, but acquires a disagreeable rancid taste.</p>

<p>The long bones are cracked and the marrow extracted. This substance
is the most highly prized portion of the animal, and in seasons of
plenty the deer are often slaughtered for the marrow alone. The fat is
placed in pots or kettles and rendered over a fire. It is then poured
into another vessel to cool, and forms a valuable article of trade and a
necessity for food, and is also required in the process of tanning the
skins.</p>

<p>The bones containing the marrow are cracked and placed in a kettle,
hung over a slow fire, and the substance melted. The marrow brings a
higher price than the tallow, and is esteemed a choice article of food.
The heads are thrown to one side until the decomposing brain is wanted
to be mixed with the semi-putrid liver for the purpose of tanning the
skins. When the flesh has dried sufficiently it is taken down and put
into packages of about thirty pounds weight each. These bundles are
enveloped in the parchment like subcutaneous tissue, and stored away
until they are needed for food. A&nbsp;species of mold attacks the flesh
if it is not frequently inspected and dried, but as it is harmless, it
does not injure the meat. Indians for weeks at a time subsist entirely
on this dried meat. They also have a season of plenty when the female
deer and the bucks of less than two years are on their way to the Cape
Chidley region. Here the females bring forth their young unmolested by
the old bucks and also less annoyed by the myriads of mosquitoes which
throng the lower parts of the country.</p>

<p>The crossing place of the females and young bucks is at or near Fort
Chimo at least each alternate year. About the 5th to the 10th of May the
assembled Indians anxiously await the coming of the game. In the course
of a few days the welcome cry of “Deer!” is heard, and the camp
immediately becomes a scene of great excitement&mdash;men hurrying to
get their guns and ammunition, women shouting the direction of the game,
and children running to the higher eminences to watch the herds.</p>

<p>The men endeavor to occupy a narrow defile, where the herd will pass
between the hills to the level land beyond. Some station themselves at
the top of the ravine, while the swiftest runners hasten to the head of
the defile to lie in ambush until the deer, urged from behind, rush
past, to be met with a volley of balls from all sides. Panic seizes the
animals, and wherever they turn an Indian confronts them. Until the deer
recover from their paralysis, and once more obey their instinct to
escape, numbers of them stand quietly waiting to be slaughtered;
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page279" id =
"page279">279</a></span>
others walk unconcernedly about, seemingly deprived of the power of
flight. The Indians hurriedly close upon them, and in a few minutes the
entire herd is destroyed or dispersed in all directions.</p>

<p>The guns used on this occasion are the cheapest kind of
muzzle-loading single-barreled shotguns. The balls used are of such size
that they will drop to the bottom of the chamber. No patching is used,
and a jar on the ground is deemed sufficient to settle the ball upon the
powder. The employment of a ramrod would require too much time, as the
Indian is actuated by the desire to kill as many as possible in the
shortest time. They do not use the necessary care in loading their guns,
and often the ball becomes lodged in the chamber and the gun bursts when
fired. When shooting downhill the ball often rolls out. It is surprising
that so few fatal accidents occur. A&nbsp;quantity of powder is poured
directly into the gun from its receptacle, the ball dropped down, and a
cap taken from between the fingers, where it was placed for convenience.
Hunters often practice the motions of rapid loading and firing. They are
remarkably expert, surpassing the Eskimo in this, though the Eskimo is
far the better marksman.</p>

<p>A third method pursued is that of snaring the deer.</p>

<p>A plan adopted to capture deer in the winter is as follows:
A&nbsp;herd of deer is discovered, and men and women put on their
snowshoes. The deer are surrounded and driven into a snowbank many feet
deep, in which the affrighted animals plunge until they nearly bury
themselves. The hunters, armed with the lance, pursue them and kill
them. This means of procuring deer is only adopted when the herd is near
a convenient snowbank of proper depth. The snow falling in the winter
collects in gullies and ravines, and only in seasons where there has
been an abundance of snow will it attain sufficient depth to serve the
purpose.</p>

<p>Smaller game, such as ducks, geese, ptarmigan, hares, rabbits,
porcupines, beavers, and an occasional lynx, afford variety of food.
Ptarmigan are slaughtered by thousands. Hundreds of pounds of their
feathers annually purchase small trinkets for the Indian women, and
during this season it is unusual to see a woman without some feathers of
these birds adhering to her clothing or hair.</p>

<p>The women and men annually destroy thousands of the eggs and young of
these birds. Rabbits and hares, too, fall beneath the arrow or shotgun.
Porcupines are more common toward the sources of the streams falling
into Hudson Strait. They are found in trees, from which they gnaw the
bark and terminal portions of the branches for food. The porcupine must
be carefully cleaned lest the flesh be unfit for food. The hair and
spines are removed by scorching or by pouring hot water over the
body.</p>

<p>Of the carnivorous mammals the lynx only is eaten, and this when
other food is scarce. Bears are so rare that they form but an
unimportant
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page280" id =
"page280">280</a></span>
portion of the Indian’s diet. Wolverines, wolves, and foxes are never
eaten.</p>

<p>Fish of various kinds are plentiful. The lakes and streams abound
with salmon in summer, and trout, white fish, suckers, and a few less
common species are eagerly sought for food. Fish are caught with the
hook or net. Fishing through holes in the ice affords an ample supply of
fine trout, and the net set along the shore upon the disappearance of
the ice is sure to reap a rich haul of white fish, suckers, and
trout.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the food little care is exercised to prevent
its coming in contact with objectionable substances. The deer meat is
laid upon the stones of the beach and particles of grit imbed themselves
in the substance. The flesh for cooking is often dropped into the
vessels in which the tallow or marrow is being rendered. Neither
children nor adults have any regular periods of eating, but appear to be
always hungry. It is thus not unusual to see a filthy child thrust its
hand into the cooling fat to obtain a choice portion of meat as it
settles to the bottom.</p>

<p>The dry meat is often pounded into a coarse powder by means of stone
or metal pestles. The meat is placed upon a smooth, hard stone for this
purpose. The ligaments are picked out, and when a sufficient quantity
has been prepared it is put into baskets or bags and stored away for
future use. The cracked bones from which the marrow was extracted are
calcined and reduced to powder and used as an absorbent of the fat from
the skins in the process of tanning.</p>

<p>The unborn young of the reindeer, taken from the mother in the
spring, are considered a prime delicacy by Indians, as well as Eskimo.
The eggs of various species of birds are eagerly sought for, and it
matters little whether they are fresh or far advanced in incubation. The
embryo bird, with the attached yolk of the egg, is swallowed with
infinite gusto. The Indian seldom eats raw flesh unless dried meat be
excepted.</p>

<p>Enough has been written concerning the reindeer to show that without
it the very existence of the Indian would be imperiled. Both food and
clothing, the prime necessities of life, are obtained from the animal,
and its numbers do not seem to decrease with the merciless or
thoughtless slaughter. Hundreds of carcases are never utilized.
I&nbsp;counted 173 carcases on one side of the river in going a distance
of about 80 miles, and when I came to their camps I saw incredible piles
of meat and skins going to waste. The winter months are occupied by men
in hunting the various fur-bearing animals, the principal of which are
white, red, cross, and black or silver foxes, martens, minks,
wolverines, wolves, muskrats, and beavers: these are abundant. Few
lynxes and bear are obtained. A&nbsp;considerable number of others are
found in this region and afford fine skins.</p>

<p>Steel traps are generally set, various sizes of traps being used for
the different animals. A&nbsp;great number of otter and beaver are shot
in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page281" id =
"page281">281</a></span>
water. Deadfalls consisting of a log of wood set upon figure-4 triggers
rarely fail to kill mink and marten. The lynx is usually taken by means
of a snare with the loop over a circle of low pegs surrounding the
tongue of the figure-4 set of triggers. The spring, usually a lithe
sapling, is strong enough to lift the forelegs of the animal from the
ground when the noose encircles its neck.</p>

<p>The Indian conceives the wolverine to be an animal embodying all the
cunning and mischief that can be contained in the skin of a beast. To
its cunning is added great bodily strength, enabling this medium-sized
animal to accomplish destruction apparently much beyond its
strength.</p>

<p>Every other animal in the forests where it dwells prefers to give it
the path rather than engage in struggle with it. When seized in a trap a
wolverine offers a sturdy resistance. Even a famished wolf, to my
personal knowledge, will stand and look at it, but not attempt to cope
with it. In this particular instance, however, the wolf may have
considered the predicament of the wolverine another means of strategy
employed by that animal to entrap the wolf, and so deemed it wise to
remain at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Every form of torture which the Indian mind is capable of conceiving
is inflicted upon this animal when it is captured. All manner of vile
names and reproaches are applied to it. The Indian enjoys relating how
he singed its fur off, broke its bones, and tormented it in many ways,
as it slowly expired under his hand.</p>

CLOTHING.</a></h5>

<p>The apparel worn by the Ungava Indians is quite distinct for the
different sexes. The method of preparing the skins for the manufacture
of garments is the same, but the forms of the garments for the sexes are
so different as to require special consideration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page282" id =
"page282">282</a></span>
<p>The garments worn by the men differ somewhat according to the season
of the year, for the extremes of climate are very great. The clothing of
the men consists of a coat, breeches, leggings, moccasins, gloves or
mittens, and cap or headdress.</p>

<p>The coat consists of the skins of the reindeer tanned into a
thoroughly pliable condition by the process to be described
presently.</p>

man’s (back).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The shape of the garment worn in summer (Figs. 87 and 88) is somewhat
similar to that of a frock coat, but without the tails. The back is cut
from a single skin and the skirt cut up from below. Into this is
inserted a piece of sufficient width to allow movement of the lower
limbs. The sides are from the second skin, split down the middle of the
back and sewed to the skin, forming the back of the garment. The back
skin forms the covering for the top of the shoulders and extends to the
collar seam. The side skins form the front and neck of the garment. The
sleeves are made of a third skin, and frequently have a roll or cuff to
increase the length, if necessary. The collar is merely a strip of skin
sewed to the neck. It is usually turned down. The front is usually open,
and if made to be closed it is held in position by a belt or gaudily
colored scarf of woolen or cotton purchased from the trader.</p>

<p>The seams of the clothing are always sewed with sinew like that used
by the Eskimo. There are but two seams which run the entire
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page283" id =
"page283">283</a></span>
length of the coat, and these are the side seams. The seam at the skirt,
the armhole, sleeve, and collar are the shorter ones. The coat is always
more or less ornamented with extravagant painted designs. The colors and
other materials used for painting these designs will be described in
another connection, as well as the manner of applying them.</p>

<p>The patterns of these designs will be best understood by reference to
the figures, which show some of them in detail (Figs. 89,&nbsp;90).</p>

<p>The colors used often present startling combinations of red, blue,
yellow, and brown. The portions of the garments upon which these colors
are placed are the front edges of the opening of the coat, the wrists,
and rings around the arms or sleeves, the skirt and pyramid-shaped
designs over the hips. The piece intended to widen the skirt behind is
always entirely covered with a design of some kind. Over the outside of
the seams a line of paint is always applied, nearly always of a red or
brown color.</p>

leggings.</p>
</div>

<p>Frequently a series of quadrate blotches or squares produced by
variously colored lines runs from the apex of the piece inserted in the
skirt to the collar.</p>

<p>The length of the coat is such as to reach to the middle of the
thigh. The coverings for the lower limbs and for the hips are quite
distinct. For the hips the garment is a sort of breeches of which the
legs are so short as only to cover the upper portion of the thigh. The
breeches are held in place by means of a drawstring in front.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page284" id =
"page284">284</a></span>
<p>A pair of these breeches is never ornamented with paint, as they are
usually not exposed to view.</p>

<p>A pair of leggings extends from the upper portion of the thigh to the
ankles. The leggings (Fig.&nbsp;91) are each made of a single piece
somewhat in the form of a narrow bag open at each end. They are held in
position by means of a string attached in front and fastened to the
upper portions of the breeches. The seam is on the outer side of the
leggings and along it is sewed a strip of deerskin having the edges cut
into fringe. The leggings are painted in much the same fashion as the
coat.</p>

<p>The moccasins (Fig. 92) are rarely ornamented, except with beads on
the tongue or else with a strip of red, blue, or black cloth.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig92" id = "fig92"> </a>
<img src = "images/fig92.png" width = "375" height = "157"
alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;Indian moccasins.</p>

<p>In the construction of a moccasin the measure of the foot is taken if
it is intended for a person of importance or if the maker attempts to do
skillful work. The sole is cut out first in the shape of a
parallelogram. The edges are turned up and creases made around that
portion of the deerskin which surrounds the toes and a part of the side
of the foot. The creases are made perpendicular in order to take up a
portion of the slack of the skin. They are held in position by a stout
sinew thread run through each one and around to the other side to
prevent them from separating and thus “bagging” over the toes. This is
the most particular part of the work and on these stitches depend the
skill of the maker. The sides of the foot and heel are not creased as
the heel-seam takes up the slack for the posterior portion of the
moccasin.</p>

<p>The tongue of the moccasin is a piece cut into a shape resembling
that member with the tip of it over the toes. This is sewed to the edges
of the creases, and between it and the creases is often sewed a narrow
welt of skin or cloth. The superfluous edges of the slipper-shaped shoe
are now trimmed off, and the top, or portion to cover the ankle, is
sewed on. This portion is a long narrow strip of inferior skin of
sufficient size to overlap in front and to come well above the ankles.
It is left open like the tops of laced shoes. Just below, or at the edge
of the tops, a&nbsp;long thong of deerskin is inserted through several
holes, which allows it to pass around the heel and below the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page285" id =
"page285">285</a></span>
ankles, bringing the ends in front over the tongue. The ends of the tops
are laid carefully over one another and wrapped round by the ends of the
thongs which hold the moccasins on the feet.</p>

<p>Certain portions of the skin make better footwear than other parts.
The neck skin is too thick and stiff to allow the creases around the
toes to be properly made; the flanks are too thin; while the neck is
useful for the tongues, the sides for the bottoms, and the flanks and
portions of the back, scarred by the grubs infesting the animal, for the
tops and strings.</p>

<p>Moccasins for young children often have a seam parallel with the toes
and the creasing is thus obviated. Those for wearing in the tent or in
the dry vicinity of the camp have no tops and are held to the foot by
means of a drawstring.</p>

<p>As most of the strain in walking comes upon the tongue, and this
portion is usually ornamented, it is necessary that it should be of a
good quality of leather. A&nbsp;piece of black, blue, or red cloth is
generally laid over the tongue for ornament. There is sometimes bead
work on this portion, but as these people are not skillful in the art of
disposing the many colored beads they are not much used for that
purpose.</p>

<p>A single deerskin will make five to seven pairs of moccasins for an
adult, and as they last but two or three weeks as many as fifteen to
twenty-five pairs are necessary for each adult.</p>

<p>The hands are protected with mittens (Fig. 93) made of smoked
deerskin. The skin is folded, and along the fold the shape of the mitten
is cut so as to leave a part by which the two pieces are joined, and the
edges formed in the cutting are sewed together. The thumb is made as
follows: A&nbsp;tongue-shaped piece is cut out of the palm and the base
of that piece is left as the part to form the under or inner covering
for the thumb. A&nbsp;piece is now trimmed that will fit the place cut
out and the two parts sewed together.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Indian mittens.</p>

<p>The thumb of the Indian is, as a rule, shorter than that of the white
man, and a pair of native-made mittens are quite uncomfortable until
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page286" id =
"page286">286</a></span>
the thumb portion has been recut and sewed. The wrists of the mittens
are often gaudily ornamented with strips of red or black cloth. Designs
of simple character, such as lines and cross lines producing
lattice-work figures, are frequently painted on the back of the mitten.
Beads in rows and zigzag lines ornament the wrist, and strands of beads
are pendant from the outside seams. The strands are often tipped with
tassels of variegated woolen threads. The mittens intended for severe
weather are often lined with the thin skin of a fœtal reindeer, which
has short, soft hair. Great exertion often causes the hands to perspire
and moisten the hair, and this freezes the instant the mitten is removed
from the hand, and is liable to freeze the fingers within it.</p>

<p>The head-dress of the men for the summer is often a large cotton
handkerchief wound turban-fashion around the head to prevent the long
hair from blowing over the face. These handkerchiefs are of the most
gaudy patterns, and if they are not worn a simple thong of deerskin
serves the purpose. The girls and newly married wives often make bands
of beads, some of which are quite attractively designed, for their
lovers or husbands. These bands are about an inch wide and several
inches long. The ends are lengthened with strips of skin. The band is
placed over the forehead and tied by the strings behind. These headbands
are generally the most intricate designs of bead work which these
Indians display (Fig.&nbsp;94).</p>

Nenenot.</p>

<p>A cap of deerskin is often worn, but it always seems to be in the
way, and is used mostly in wet weather. A&nbsp;piece of stiff deerskin
is sometimes made into the shape of a visor of a cap and worn over the
eyes during the spring when the glare of the sun on the snow produces
such distressing inflammation of the eyes. It is fastened to the head by
means of straps tied behind. The greater part of the men prefer to go
without head covering. Some who are able and love a display of fancy
colors have a cap made of red cloth and ornamented with beads worked
into extravagant patterns. The cap is a high conical affair, and from
the weight of beads upon it often falls to one side of the head.</p>

<p>The winter coat (Figs. 95, 96) worn by the males is of different
pattern from that worn in summer, and is made of skins with the hair
inside.</p>

<p>Two skins, one of which forms the back of the coat the other the
front, are sewed by side seams running from the armpit to the bottom of
the skirt. On the shoulder a seam runs to the neck on each side, the
back skin extending high enough to form the neck while the other skin
reaches to the neck in front. Here it is slightly cut out or slit for a
distance of several inches to allow the insertion of the head through
the neck hole.</p>

<p>Sometimes a <span class = "sans">V</span>-shaped piece is inserted
into the slit at the front of the neck. To widen the skirts a similar
shaped piece is let into the middle of the back skin; or it may be put
between the side seams for the same purpose. The bottom of the skirt is
decorated. (Fig.&nbsp;97.)</p>

<p>At the back of the neck a piece about 8 inches square is attached to
the garment. This sometimes serves as a collar, and sometimes it gives
additional protection by a double thickness to the shoulders, very often
the first part to feel the effect of the piercing winds.</p>

<p>A few of the coats for winter have a hood attached to them (Fig.
98,&nbsp;99) sewed on the back of the neck, which when drawn over the
head serves at once as cap and protection.</p>

<p>The collar and hood are invariably made from the skins on the sides
of the head of the deer. If two or more head skins are required they are
sewed into the form of the deer’s head. The collar is ornamented with
fringes cut from the edges of the skin. Sometimes the interscapular
protection is cut into three or four points, each one of which is the
cheek skin of a deer, and sewed only a portion of the length, the
remainder being left free and terminating with a series of long strands
or fringes. The sleeves of these garments have nothing peculiar about
them.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page288" id =
"page288">288</a></span>
<p>As the Indian is always in the vicinity of the herds of deer it is an
easy matter for him to obtain the skins when in best condition, and from
the finer skins superior garments are made. The shape of the Indian’s
coat is not so well adapted to afford protection as that of the Eskimo;
hence, the white men in this region invariably adopt the clothing of the
latter in cold weather.</p>

<p>Indians eagerly accept any cast off garment which a white man has
worn, and they often procure the clothing offered for trade. Trousers
are in much demand. Coats are deemed great prizes, especially in the wet
seasons when the moisture would certainly ruin their own clothing by
causing the hair to fall off or totally destroy the shape of the tanned
skin garments. For underclothing the Indian man uses an additional suit
of ordinary clothing or else dons a shirt procured from the trader.
Drawers are rarely worn.</p>

<p>That these people are little susceptible to the effects of cold may
be inferred from the fact that I have seen them come to the trading post
of Fort Chimo in the middle
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page289" id =
"page289">289</a></span>
of winter when the thermometer had not registered higher than 20° below
zero for weeks, with no protection for their legs except a pair of old
buckskin leggings so short that the bottom did not reach within 3 or 4
inches of the dilapidated moccasins. The feet were, so far as could be
ascertained, chiefly protected by a wrapping of old baling cloth covered
with a pair of moccasins which no white man would have been seen
wearing. I&nbsp;observed also that no additional clothing was purchased
for the return trip.</p>

<p>The garments worn by the women in the warmer season consists of thin
dresses of calico purchased from the traders. Thin shawls serve to
protect the head and shoulders. The feet are incased in moccasins. Some
of the women are able to purchase dresses of cloth, and these are cut
into a semblance of the dresses worn by the women of civilized
countries. It is not rare to see a woman wearing a skirt made from the
tanned skin of the deer. The lower portions of the skirt are often
fancifully ornamented with lines and stripes of paint of various colors,
extending entirely around the garment. A&nbsp;piece of baling cloth is
often fashioned into a skirt and worn.</p>

<p>The females appear to be less susceptible to the sudden changes of
the summer weather than the men. At least they exhibit less concern
about the thickness of their apparel. It is not unusual to see a woman
whose only clothing appears to be a thin dress of calico. During the
winter the women dress in the most comfortable skins (Fig. 100),
blankets, shawls, comforts, leggings, and moccasins. During
exceptionally severe weather, they appear as traveling wardrobes,
doubtless carrying their all on their back, and in some instances
presenting a most comical
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page290" id =
"page290">290</a></span>
appearance as, loaded with clothing of most miscellaneous character,
they waddle over the snow. The winter cap is similar to that worn by the
men, but is not so peaked. It is an object on which they expend a great
amount of labor. The material is usually a kind of cloth locally known
as Hudson bay cloth, either red, dark blue, light blue, or black. The
caps of the men and women are usually made from the better grades of
this cloth, while the dresses of the women and the leggings of the men
are of the inferior grades.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;Nenenot woman in full
winter dress.</p>

<p>If the cap is to be all one color, in which case it is always red,
the cloth is cut in two pieces only, and put together so as to produce a
cup-shape. Sometimes five or six pieces are cut from two or three
different colors of cloth and the strips sewed together. Over the seams
white tape is sewed to set off the colors. In the center of the strip is
a rosette, cross, or other design worked with beads, and around the rim
rows of beads variously arranged.</p>

<p>The body is covered with a heavy robe made of two deerskins sewed
together. This robe is often plain, and when ornamented designs are
painted only on the bottom of the skirt. These robes are always of skins
with the hair on. The flesh side is often rubbed with red ocher while
the extreme edge may be painted with a narrow stripe of the same mixed
with the viscid matter obtained from the roe of a species of fish. The
edge stripe of paint is always of a darker brown than the other colors
from the admixture of that substance with the earth.</p>

<p>This garment is put upon the body in a manner impossible to describe
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page291" id =
"page291">291</a></span>
and difficult to understand even when witnessed. It is held together by
small loops of sinew or deerskin. A&nbsp;belt around the waist keeps it
up.</p>

<p>The women also wear in winter a sleeveless gown reaching little below
the knees and as high as the chin. The sleeves are put on separately,
like leggings. They are usually made of red or black cloth.</p>

<p>The gown is often extravagantly decorated with paint. The flesh side
of the skin is rubbed with red ocher, on which are painted in
describable designs. A&nbsp;strip of deerskin dotted with beads borders
the gown, and from the edge of the strip hang strings of these
ornaments, terminating in variously colored tassels of thread.</p>

<p>The leggings of the women differ from those of the men. They extend
higher and the bottoms cover the tops of the moccasins. They are made of
skin or cloth, the latter black or red. To cut out a pair of leggings
requires skill. The cloth is doubled and then cut nearly in a circular
form. A&nbsp;size sufficient to fit the limb is sewed up leaving the
crescent-shaped remainder a flapping ornament. The “wings” are often
edged with cloth of a different color and on the outer border rows of
beads complete the decoration. The two crescents are left free, and as
the wind separates them they flap most fantastically. They are always
worn so as to be on the outer side of the legs. The bottoms of the
leggings are heavily loaded with numerous rows of fancy beads.</p>

<p>Moccasins are alike for both sexes.</p>

<p>As additional protection from cold the shoulders are covered with a
mantle of soft skins from young deer. Blankets purchased from the
traders are also sometimes thrown over the shoulders or around the
waist.</p>

<p>Children are clad like adults, excepting that their apparel is less
carefully made and they often present a disgusting appearance, with
their clothing glazed with filth and glistening with vermin.</p>

<p>Infants usually have their garments made in the “combination” form.
The cap forms a separate piece and is fitted so closely that it is not
removed until the growth of the head bursts the material of which the
cap is made.</p>

<p>When traveling men and women smoke or snuff a good deal.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page292" id =
"page292">292</a></span>
Tobacco and a few other necessary articles are carried in a bag known as
“fire bag.” These are made of cloth and trimmed with beads, and are
often quite tastefully ornamented.</p>

<p>The detailed figures which I have presented show much better than any
description the designs used in ornamenting their clothing. Some of the
patterns are rude copies of the designs found upon cheap handkerchiefs,
scarfs, and other printed fabrics.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the headbands worked for the men by their
wives and sweethearts. Such a headband, made of sealskin procured from
the Eskimo, is shown in Fig. 101 (No.&nbsp;3449). The headband is used
to support the weight of a load carried on the back, relieving the
strain on the shoulders and making it easier to breathe. The band passes
over the forehead to the back, where it is attached to the load. Various
forms of these headbands or portage straps are made. Sometimes a piece
of birch bark is placed under the strap where it touches the forehead.
It is said that the bark does not become wet from the moisture induced
by the severe exertion and thus burn the head.</p>

PREPARATION OF THE SKINS FOR CLOTHING.</a></h5>

<p>Having now given a general description of the clothing of the
Nenenot,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page293" id =
"page293">293</a></span>
I may proceed to describe the process of preparing the skins of which
this clothing is made. The skins of the deer, which are to be converted
into buckskin and parchment, are laid to one side in a heap, just as
they came from the bodies of the animals or after they have gone through
a process to be subsequently described.</p>

<p>When the skins have laid in this heap for several days decomposition
sets in and loosens the hair so it will readily pull out. When the pelt
is ready for scraping it is thrown over a round stick of wood some 3 or
4 inches in diameter and 3 or 4 feet long, one end of which rests on the
ground while the other is pressed against the abdomen of the woman who
is doing the work. Then she takes a tool like a spoke shave (Figs. 102,
103, No. 3162) made from the radius of the deer, by cutting a slice off
the middle part of the back of the bone, so as to make a sharp edge
while the untouched ends serve for handles, and with this scrapes off
the loosened hair.</p>

<p>The sharp edge of the bone instrument coming against the hairs pushes
or pulls them out but does not cut the skin.</p>

</div>

<p>The flesh side of the pelt is now worked to free it from particles of
flesh and blood, together with as much of the moisture in the skin as
may be hastily done, for if the person has a great number of skins to
attend to she must work rapidly lest they decompose too much and
putrefy.</p>

<p>Where the hunter has great success in killing deer many of the skins
are left untouched because there is no one to attend to them and they
are thus wasted.</p>

<p>When the pelts of the deer or other large animals have been taken
from the carcass they are allowed to dry with the adherent flesh, fat,
and ligaments until a convenient opportunity occurs to remove those
portions from the skin, which must be moistened to permit them to be
more readily scraped off. If the fresh skins are to be cleaned
immediately, they are operated upon in the same manner as those
previously dried. All the skins of fur-bearing animals and those
furnishing skins for clothing and other purposes must be scraped,
otherwise they would soon be soiled by the infiltration of the fat among
the hairs.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page294" id =

<p>To remove the adherent particles on the flesh side of the skin a
peculiar instrument has been devised. The tibia, or large bone of the
hind leg of the reindeer, is used for this purpose (Fig. 104). The
peculiar shape of the bone renders it particularly well adapted to form
a combination of saw, chisel, and gouge at the same time. The lower
portion of the bone is cut squarely off. A&nbsp;part of one side of the
remainder is cut so as to leave one side (the inner side of the bone) in
the shape of a chisel, having either a straight edge or else slightly
rounded. On this edge are cut a number of fine notches, which give the
edge of the instrument a serrated form. Some of the bones have a
spatula-shaped piece of iron or steel cut with the serrations upon it
and the metal piece set in the cavity of the bone. If the leg of a deer
is not convenient a wooden handle shaped like the long handle of a
mortising chisel is fashioned, and to it is affixed the metal point by
means of stout lashings (Fig. 105). Around the upper portion of the
wooden shaft a notch or groove is cut, and in this is tied a stout thong
in such manner as to form a loop to prevent the hand from slipping down
the smooth bone when the blow is struck.</p>

<p>The manner of using this instrument is peculiar and effective. The
skin is thrown, with the flesh side up, over a stake 2 or 3 feet high
driven firmly into the ground. The person kneels down before the stake,
and when the skin is placed so as to afford a convenient portion to
begin upon, an edge is taken between the fingers of the left hand and
lifted slightly from the ground. A&nbsp;blow is given with the tool
which separates the subcutaneous tissue, and by rightly directed blows
this may be separated from the skin entire. The skin is then laid aside
for further working. The subcutaneous tissue is washed and dried, after
which it is used for a variety of purposes, such as coverings for
bundles of dried meat and other articles.</p>

<p>The skin is worked over with this instrument to free it from a
portion of its moisture and is now ready to receive the tanning material
which consists of a mixture of putrefying brain, liver, and fat. They
sometimes soak the skin in wine, which is reputed to add greatly to the
lasting qualities of the leather, but the odor of that liquid lasts as
long as the skin.</p>

<p>The tanning material is laid on the flesh side of the skin in a thin
layer and by rubbing with the hands it is well worked in. Several
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page295" id =
"page295">295</a></span>
hours or days elapse and the superfluous matter is scraped off. The skin
is then scraped and rubbed between the hands, the harder portions with a
scraper resembling a small scoop, until all the skin is worked into a
pliable condition. If the skin is yet too oily a quantity of powdered
chalk, clay, calcined bone, or even flour, is thoroughly rubbed over it
to absorb any fatty matter yet remaining.</p>

<p>The skins having the hair on, for clothing, or those intended for
buckskin, are treated in this manner. Those intended for parchment are
simply rubbed with a quantity of fat, and then allowed to dry in that
condition, being of a yellowish or pale glue color.</p>

<p>Where a great number of skins have to be prepared, and some of the
more energetic men have as many as two or three hundred buckskins and
parchment skins for the spring trade, a&nbsp;constant application to
this labor is necessary in order to prepare them in season. This, in a
manner, accounts for the number of wives which an energetic or wealthy
man may have in order that the products of the chase falling to his
share may be promptly attended to.</p>

<p>When the skins intended for sale are selected they are bundled up and
covered with parchment skins or the subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<p>The skins intended for use among themselves are generally inferior
grades, such as those cut in the skinning process, or else those
obtained in the earlier or the later part of the season.</p>

<p>A species of <ins class = "correction" title = "spaced as shown">gad
fly</ins> infests the deer, puncturing the skin on both sides of the
spine, and depositing within the wound an egg which in time is
transformed into a grub or larva. These larvæ attain the size of the
first joint of the little finger, and at the opening of the spring
weather work their way through the skin and fall to the ground, where
they undergo metamorphoses to become perfect insects.</p>

<p>A single animal may have hundreds of these grubs encysted beneath the
skin, which, on their exit, leave a deep suppurating cavity, which heals
slowly. The skin forming the cicatrices does not have the same texture
as the untouched portions.</p>

<p>When the skin is dressed it reveals these scars, and of course, the
value of the skin is diminished according to their number. The Indian
often endeavors to conceal them by rubbing flour or chalk over them.</p>

<p>The season when the skins are in the best condition is from September
to the middle of December. The freshly deposited eggs have not yet
produced larvæ of sufficient size to injure the skin, and the wounds
produced by those dropping out in the month of May have healed and left
the skin in condition.</p>

<p>Certain skins intended for special purposes must be smoked. The
process of smoking tends to render it less liable to injury from
moisture. The pyroligneous vapors act as antiseptics and thus at least
retard decomposition of those articles most exposed to wet. The tents
and foot wear are always tanned with the smoke and this process is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page296" id =
"page296">296</a></span>
always subsequent to that of bringing the skins into the pliable
condition.</p>

<p>The process adopted by these Indians in smoking the deerskins is as
follows: The woods are searched for rotten wood of a special character.
It must be affected with a kind of dry rot which renders the fibers of a
spongy nature. This is procured and thoroughly dried. The skins to be
smoked are selected and two of nearly the same size and condition are
chosen, and sewed into the form of a bag with the hairy side within. The
after portions of the skin are suspended from a convenient pole and the
head and neck portions left free or open. To the edges of these is sewed
a cloth, usually a piece of baling cloth, and this is also left open.
The rotten wood is placed in a pan or vessel and as it smolders, never
burning into a blaze, the pale, blue, pungent smoke is allowed to ascend
within the cavity of the deerskin bag. The cloth is merely to form a
conduit for the smoke as the skin should not be too near the fire.</p>

<p>As the process continues the skins are inspected between the stitches
of the sewing and when the operation has progressed sufficiently they
are taken down. It will now be found that the surface has assumed a
pale, clear brown color, the shade of which depends on the length of the
exposure to the smoke.</p>

<p>The cloth is removed and the skins are immediately folded, with the
smoked side within, and laid away for several days to season. If,
however, the skin be left to the influence of the air the coloring
matter immediately disappears leaving it of a color only slightly
different from what it was before it was smoked.</p>

<p>The scars, made by the larvæ of the insects, do not “take” the smoke
as well as the healthy portions and so present a pitted or scaly
appearance. From the skins having an abundance of the scars are made the
tents and inferior grades of moccasins and the tops of the <ins class =

<p>The paints used for decorating the buckskin garments are applied by
means of bits of bone or horn of a peculiar shape best understood from

<p>The pigments used are procured from different sources. From the
traders are obtained indigo in the crude condition or in the form of
washing blue, vermilion in small buckskin bags, and a few other colors.
An abundance of red earth occurs in several localities. The pigments are
reduced to the finest possible condition and kneaded with the fingers
until ready for the addition of water often mixed with a slight quantity
of oil or tallow. A&nbsp;favorite vehicle for the paint is the prepared
roe of a sucker (<i>Catastomus</i>) abounding in the waters of the
district. The female fish are stripped of the mass of ova which is
broken up in a vessel and the liquid strained through a coarse cloth.
The color is a faint yellow which becomes deeper with age. The fluid is
allowed to dry and when required for use is dissolved in water. It has
then a semiviscid consistence and in this condition is mixed with the
various pigments. When a yellowish color is desired the fish-egg
preparation is applied alone. The albumen gives sufficient adhesive
quality to the paint and produce a rich glaze, giving a good effect to
the otherwise dull colors.</p>

<p>The process of preparing the crude mineral colors is quite tedious as
the attrition is produced by rubbing the substance between two smooth
stones, a&nbsp;little water occasionally being added to hold the
particles together. The prepared paints are put in the vessels already
described, and when ready for use a quantity is taken with the finger
and placed in the palm of the hand while the other fingers hold the
instrument by which it is to be applied. The paint stick is carefully
drawn through the thin layer of paint spread on the other palm and a
quantity, depending on the thickness of the layer, adheres to the edges
of the appliance and by a carefully guided motion of the hand the lines
desired are produced. The eye
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page298" id =
"page298">298</a></span>
alone guides the drawing, however intricate it may be. The artist
frequently attempts to imitate some of the delicate designs on a gaudy
bandana handkerchief or some similar fabric. The principal source of the
hematite is a lake near the headwaters of George’s river where it occurs
as a mass of disintegrated rock along the margin. The water has by
freezing split great quantities from the mass and when there is a strong
wind from the opposite direction the water is often lashed into a
blood-red foam.</p>

DWELLINGS.</a></h5>

<p>The Nenenot live, both in summer and in winter, in deerskin tent,
(see Fig. 114), which are constructed in the following manner:
A&nbsp;sufficient number of small poles cut from the woods are deprived
of their branches and brought to the camp site. A&nbsp;location is
selected and the poles are erected in a circle, with tops leaning toward
the center so as to form a cone 10 to 14 feet in height, having a
diameter at its base of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page299" id =
"page299">299</a></span>
from 10 to 18 feet. The skins forming the cover are those of the
reindeer, and those selected for this purpose are usually of an inferior
grade. A&nbsp;sufficient number are sewed together to form a strip long
enough to reach around the poles when set up. As the tents differ in
size according to the number of people who occupy them, the skins sewed
together may be from eight to twelve. The first strip is made for the
lower part of the poles and is attached to them by means of strings
fastened within. A&nbsp;second strip is made to go around the upper part
of the poles, and is, of course, correspondingly shorter. It is placed
last so as to overlap the lower breadth and thus prevent rain and snow
from blowing in. The door is usually made of one large skin or two
smaller ones. It is tied to the poles at the upper corners and at the
lower has a small log of wood as a weight to prevent it from flapping.
The poles at the apex are not covered and through them the smoke from
the fire built in the center within ascends and finds exit.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 114.</span>&mdash;Nenenot Indian
tent.</p>

<p>The interior of the tent is arranged to suit the occupants. The floor
is usually covered with the branches of young spruce, and when carefully
laid these form an admirable protection from the cold ground and a soft
carpeting.</p>

<p>The women who lay this flooring display great taste, and certain of
them are noted for their skill in disposing the branches. The center of
the tent is reserved for the fire which is built there among a few
stones.</p>

<p>The occupants arrange themselves according to the importance of the
place they occupy in the family. The owner or head man is always to be
found on the side opposite the fire. This is considered a place of
honor, to which all guests who are to be complimented are invited to a
seat.</p>

<p>The other members of the group arrange themselves along the sides of
the tent, and those who have been adopted into the family occupy
positions next the doorway.</p>

<p>Over the fire may be poles reaching across the tent, and on these
will be suspended kettles and pots obtained from the traders. The
cooking utensils are few in number, one vessel serving various
purposes.</p>

<p>The hunting gear and the skins of animals, together with the articles
belonging to the females may be seen suspended from various portions of
the interior. Around the edges are the blankets of deerskin, and those
bought from the traders, lying in disorder. The outer edge of the
interior is slightly raised above the center, and affords a convenient
slope for those who desire to sleep. The occupants always sleep with
their feet toward the fireplace, around which there is no brush, lest it
be set on fire during sleep and destroy the tent.</p>

<p>They have regular hours for sleeping, but as these are only for a
period of short duration, it is not unusual to find half the inmates
asleep at any time a tent is visited.</p>

<p>The preparation of the food appears to go on at all times, and there
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page300" id =
"page300">300</a></span>
are no regular hours for partaking of their meals, as each person eats
when convenient. The food is taken directly from the pot or kettle, and
each one helps himself. Forks are not used, and the food is divided with
a knife or torn with the fingers.</p>


<h5><a name = "nene_sweat" id = "nene_sweat">
SWEAT HOUSES.</a></h5>

<p>The Nenenot are in the habit of taking steam baths, for which purpose
they use a sudatory or sweat house, constructed as follows:
A&nbsp;number of flexible poles of small size, usually willow or alder,
which grow to sufficient size along the banks of the streams, are bent
to form a hemispherical or dome-shaped structure, which is covered with
tent skins. A&nbsp;sandy locality is selected or one free from snow in
winter, and a fierce fire is built. When it is well under way a number
of stones are thrown into the fire to heat. When the heat is sufficient
the fire is removed and the structure is quickly erected over the hot
stones and some one from the outside fastens down the edges of the
tenting with stones to prevent the loss of heat. A&nbsp;kettle of water
previously placed within the bath house is used to pour over the stones,
when heat rises to a suffocating degree and produces the desired
perspiration. Water is not used to bathe in, though sometimes a slight
quantity is poured upon the head only. The bather remains within the hut
until the heat has nearly exhausted him.</p>

<p>These baths are frequently taken, and often when he has just started
on a journey the head of the family will be seized with a desire to have
a bath. Everything must await this operation before the journey is
resumed.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred at Fort Chimo in the spring of 1882.
That season the reindeer were extremely numerous at that place, as they
were crossing to go to the northeast to drop the fawns. Often when the
herds or bands were panic stricken they rushed among the Indian tents,
the houses of the station, and, in fact, everywhere, with yelping dogs
and screaming women and children at their heels. An old man and wife
were in the sweat house at a time when a very large drove of the deer,
in their frantic endeavors to escape their pursuers, headed directly for
the bath. Some one screamed to the occupants to look out for the deer.
The man and wife made their exit just as a score or more of the animals
reached the spot. The man tore up the tenting of the bath house and
whirled it in the air, while the old woman cut the most astonishing
antics. The whole population witnessed the occurrence and did not fail
to help increase the tumult. Signs of former sudatories are quite common
along the paths where the Indians have traveled for many years.</p>


<h5><a name = "nene_household" id = "nene_household">
HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS, ETC.</a></h5>

<p>Each household is supplied with sundry wooden vessels of various
sizes (Fig. 115) which serve for buckets for holding water and for
drinking
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page301" id =
"page301">301</a></span>
cups. They are made of strips of thin boards cut from spruce or from
larch trees, the wider strips being as much as six inches wide and
one-third of an inch thick. They are steamed and bent into ovoid or
circular forms and the ends of the strip overlapping. Then they are
sewed with split roots from those trees. A&nbsp;groove is cut near the
lower edge and into it is placed a dish-shaped piece of wood for a
bottom.</p>

<p>These vessels are identical in shape and function with those
manufactured by the Yukon river Indians of Alaska.</p>

<p>They also use berry-dishes or baskets like Fig. 116 made from the
bark of the spruce peeled in the spring of the year. At this time the
bark is quite flexible and may be bent into the desired shape. The
corners are sewed with coarse roots from the same tree and the rim is
strengthened by a strip of root sewed over and around it by means of a
finer strand. These baskets serve a good purpose when the women are
picking berries, of which they are inordinately fond; and during that
season it is a rarity to see a woman or man without a mouth stained the
peculiar blue color which these berries impart.</p>

<p>Baskets of this shape frequently have a top of buckskin sewed to
them, closed with a drawstring, as shown in Fig. 117 (No.&nbsp;3485).
Such things serve to hold trinkets and other small articles.</p>

<p>Large objects are carried in bags, either long or basket-shaped, made
of the skins of deer legs. The leg skins are scraped and worked to a
moderate degree of pliability and their edges sewed together until a
sufficient number have been joined to make the bag of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page302" id =
"page302">302</a></span>
required size. This bag is used to hold the clothing, furs, and other
valuables. When on a trip they are invariably carried. If the journey be
performed on foot the two ends are tied with a thong and the bag thrown
over the shoulder.</p>

<p>In preparing food stone pestles of various sizes were formerly used
of the shape shown in Fig. 118. These pestles are now mostly out of date
and superseded by cast-iron ones with steel faces, procured from the
traders. The metal pounders, however, are so heavy that they are
objectionable to people who have to make their burdens on the portages
as light as possible.</p>

of wood.</p>

TOBACCO AND PIPES.</a></h5>

<p>Like all other Indians, these people are inordinately fond of tobacco
for smoking, chewing, and snuff; the latter, however, is used only by
aged individuals, especially the females, whose countenances show the
effect in a manner quite disgusting. The men consider a supply of
tobacco of as much importance as the supply of ammunition for the
prosecution of the chase. The first request upon meeting an Indian is
that you furnish him with a chew or a pipe full. Little satisfactory
intercourse can be had with him until he is mollified by a gift of
tobacco. The first thing that an Indian receives when arriving at the
trading post is a clay pipe and a plug of tobacco. The pint of molasses
and the three or four hard biscuit (which have received the local name
of ‘Canadian padlock,’ doubtless because they are so difficult to open),
are of secondary consideration. When the spring arrivals are camped
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page303" id =
"page303">303</a></span>
at the station it is not unusual for several to contribute a number of
plugs of tobacco and a gallon of molasses. These are boiled together and
then water is added to the mixture. This villainous compound is drunk
until a state of stupefaction ensues. The muddled creature under the
influence of that liquor seems like an idiot. The effect is terrible and
does not wear away for several days. The pipes used for smoking are made
of stone obtained from river pebbles, usually a fine-grained compact
sandstone. The color of this stone varies from a dark reddish brown
nearly the color of clotted blood to a lighter shade of that color. The
red stones often have spots of every size and shape of a yellowish drab
which form a strange contrast with the darker colors. The darker the
stone the less spotting it will have. The best of all the pipes and
those most valued are of greenish sandstone having strata of darker
colors which appear as beautiful graining when the pipe is cut into form
and polished.</p>

STONE TOBACCO PIPES.</p>

<p>Other pipes are of hard slate and very dark without markings. All the
material is hard and the effect of the fire within renders them harder
and liable to crack if used in very cold weather. These pipes vary but
little in shape (I&nbsp;have figured three&mdash;Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXXVIII</span> and Fig. 123&mdash;to show the pattern), but
there is considerable difference in size. The largest ones are made of
the green stone, while the smaller ones are made of other stones. The
stem is of spruce wood and is prepared by boring a small hole through
the stick lengthwise and whittling it down to the required size. It is
from 4 to 8 inches long and is often ornamented with a band of many
colored beads.</p>

<p>The rough stone for a pipe is selected and chipped into crude form.
The successive operations of wearing it down to the desired size are
accomplished by means of a coarse file or a harder stone. The amount of
labor bestowed upon a pipe consumes several days’ time before the final
polish is given.</p>

<p>The value set upon these pipes is according to the color of the
stone, as much as the amount of labor expended in making them. They are
always filthy, partly on account of the bad quality of tobacco used. The
ashes and other accumulations within are removed by means of a
bodkin-shaped instrument of bone or horn. The back of a broken horn comb
is a favorite material for making a decorated pipe-cleaner (Fig.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page304" id =
"page304">304</a></span>
124). The ornamentations consist of cruciform and quadrate figures on
the handle. The tobacco used for smoking is the commonest black plug of
very inferior quality, soaked with molasses and licorice. This moist
tobacco is cut into pieces and a coal of fire placed upon it. They
prefer this quality, and purchase the lighter and drier kinds only to
serve as kindling for the darker sort.</p>

<p>They do not know how to brew or ferment liquors of any kind, and as
the importation of intoxicants is wisely prohibited, the native has no
opportunity to indulge in his craving for liquors, the supply of which
was plentiful in former years. A&nbsp;spruce beer is made by the
servants of the company for the holidays, and a taste is sometimes given
to a favorite Indian, who is so easily affected that a pint of this mild
beer will send him reeling and happy to his tent, where it soon becomes
known that beer is to be had. The importunities for drink are now so
frequent, that the barrel must be emptied of its contents in order to
avoid the constant beggings for it.</p>

<p>All the Indians of this region use birch-bark canoes, of the pattern
shown in the figure (Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">XXXIX</span>,
from a photograph; the collection also contains six wooden models of
these canoes). The style of canoe used by the Little Whale river Indians

and stern than those used in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page305" id =

valley of the Koksoak. The canoe of each individual differs from others
according to the personal taste or need of the maker. The requirements
are that the canoe shall be able to transport himself and family,
together with the household property, whenever it is desired to change
camps. Some of the canoes are small, others large, often possessed by
two or more individuals in common.</p>

BIRCH-BARK CANOE, NENENOT, KOKSOAK RIVER PATTERN.</p>

<p>These canoes are constructed in the following manner: Trees are
selected which when split will afford a number of straight-grained slats
free from knots. These slats are shaved to the required thickness and
laid aside to season. They are 3 or 4 inches wide and less than
one-third of an inch in thickness. The exterior or longitudinal strips
are placed so that their edges will touch each other. The inside strips
or ribs are placed about their own width apart, and of course are placed
at right angles to the longitudinal slats. They are thinner than the
side strips and become almost like shavings at the bow and stern. The
two layers of slats form a kind of shell upon which the skin of bark
fits tightly. The first process with the bark is to free it from the
outside scaling layers; the next is to soak it for several days in fresh
water to soften it; otherwise, when dry it would crack like an eggshell.
When it has macerated a sufficient time it is taken out and laid over a
form of clay or other earth, which has previously been roughly molded to
the shape of the interior of the canoe. The bark is now sewed along the
edges of the strips with roots of the spruce tree. These are long and
tough, and resemble splits of rattan when properly prepared for the
purpose by splitting and shaving with a knife. Various sizes of these
roots are used for the different portions. The threads are also soaked
in water until they become so flexible that they may be tied into a knot
without breaking.</p>

<p>When the bark skin rudely conforms to the shape of the mold of earth,
the rails or round strips of wood along the inner edge of the canoe are
placed in position and the ends of the bark strips laid over it and
sewed. A&nbsp;second rail is now laid upon the first and drawn down to
it by means of the root thongs. A&nbsp;piece of wood is shaped for the
bow and one for the stern and inserted in position, and the end seams of
the canoe are sewed over these pieces.</p>

<p>The interior is then ready for the longitudinal strips, which are
placed at the bottom first and gradually built up on each side until the
rails are reached. The ribs or transverse strips are next placed in
position. Five or more crosspieces, or thwarts, are fastened to the side
rails to give stiffness to the sides and to prevent collapsing, and they
may be set either below or above the rail. The greatest care must be
exercised to give to both sides of the canoe the same shape and to have
the keel evenly balanced. This is rudely regulated by the eye during the
process of construction. After all the strips are put in, the boat is
allowed to season and dry. This causes the bark to shrink, and while
drying the whole is frequently inspected to discover any splits or
cracks in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page306" id =
"page306">306</a></span>
the bark. The Indian often wets the canoe, lest it dry too rapidly and
split under the tension. When the form and make are satisfactory the
seams are smeared with a mixture of spruce gum (or&nbsp;resin bought
from the traders), mixed with seal oil to render it less easily broken.
This mixture is while hot laid upon the dry surface with a small
paddle.</p>

<p>After the gum has seasoned for a day or so the canoe is put upon the
water and tested for its speed and seaworthiness. All leaks and needed
repairs are immediately attended to, and it is at length ready for
use.</p>

<p>Many persons have not the skill needed to construct a canoe, and they
employ those who have had experience and are known to build an excellent
boat.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of canoes in use among those Indians, differing
only in the shape of the stern and prow. The original form was nearly
flat along the rails and had the bow and stern but little turned up. Of
later years intercourse with some of their neighbors has induced them to
modify the nearly straight edge canoe into an intermediate shape between
their own and that of the East Main Indians, whose canoes are very much
turned up, and are acknowledged to be far superior vessels to those of
the Ungava Indians.</p>

<p>As the forests in the vicinity of Fort Chimo do not contain birch
trees, and none are found until the headwaters of the Koksoak are
reached, where they are too small to afford bark of sufficient size and
thickness, the Indians are compelled to procure the bark from the
traders, who import it from the St. Lawrence river and gulf stations to
Fort Chimo. It comes in bundles large enough to cover a single canoe of
moderate size. If a canoe is to be very large two bundles are required.
The value of a black fox skin purchases a bundle of bark.</p>

<p>During the spring months, while the weather is somewhat warm, the men
are engaged in preparing the strips and bark for the canoe which is to
convey them up the river when the ice breaks and the river is open for
navigation.</p>

<p>The paddle has a single blade with a handle scarcely more than half
the length of the paddle. It is used with both hands, the strokes being
given on alternate sides as it glides through the water.</p>

<p>When it is necessary that a portage be made the voyager takes the
canoe upon his shoulders by letting one of the center thwarts rest on
the back of the neck. The hands are thrown backward to hold up the end
of the canoe from the ground. A&nbsp;headband, such as I have already
described, of birch bark or cloth, often fancifully ornamented with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page307" id =
"page307">307</a></span>
beads, fits over the forehead and is attached to the sides of the canoe
by means of thongs, which prevent the canoe from slipping off the
shoulders as the porter quickly traverses the narrow pathway through the
trees and bushes. The ground is often so uneven and rough that long
detours have to be made by the porter, while the rest of the party may
go a shorter path to the place where the canoe will again be placed in
the water. A&nbsp;part of the necessary equipments for a trip in a canoe
are pieces of bark, root threads, and gum to repair any damage resulting
from an accidental contact with a stone or snag.</p>

<p>Without the birch-bark canoe the Indian would have difficulty in
obtaining his living, as it is even more necessary than the sled, and
nearly as useful as the snowshoe.</p>

<p>The paddles used with these canoes are about 5 feet long, having a
blade about 30 inches long and 4½ wide. The handle terminates in a sort
of knob. The paddle referred to, for applying the gum and grease to the
seams of the canoe, has the shape of a flattened spoon with rounded bowl
(Fig. 125). The gum is heated, and while hot is poured along the seams
and pressed into the interstices of the stitches with the paddle. When a
patch is to be applied over a fracture or broken place in the bark, it
may be made to adhere by the sticky properties of the gum alone, if the
distance to be traveled is not great. A&nbsp;fire is then made and the
wax heated; the piece of bark is edged with the gum and pressed firmly
over the rent. A&nbsp;second coat is applied over the edges of the bark,
after the first has become cold. A&nbsp;few minutes suffice to repair an
apparently alarming hole.</p>

BY LAND.</a></h6>

<p>For carrying loads over the snow all the Indians of this region use
large sleds (Figs. 126, 127) called tá-bas-kán, which is a word
equivalent to the well known name “toboggan.” These sleds, as used among
the Indians under consideration, differ very greatly in size according
to the use for which they are designed.</p>

<p>The method of construction is as follows: A tree is selected as free
from knots as possible and two boards of less than an inch in thickness
are hewed or split from it. These boards are further dressed to the
required thickness and width. The final operation consists in shaving
them down with a “crooked knife” to little more than half an inch in
thickness. One edge of each board is then straightened and the two edges
placed together. The length is rarely more than 13 feet. The front end
is steamed or heated in a kettle of hot water until the boards become
flexible. The ends are turned up to the desired curve and then bent over
at the end, where they are held in position by a transverse bar of wood.
This bar is slightly concave on the side next the sled and gives the
nose a curved shape. The curved portion of the front may rise as much as
18 inches above the surface over which the sled travels. At the place
where the curve begins a second transverse bar is placed, and at a
distance behind it a third, fourth, and fifth bars are fastened.
Sometimes an additional bar is to be found on the upper side of the
bottom. These bars are all fastened to the two bottom boards by means of
thongs of parchment deerskin, and run through holes on the bottom
boards. On the under side the thongs are let into places cut out between
the two holes, so that the thongs will not be worn when passing over the
snow. They are usually fastened in four places, one at each end of the
bar and one on each side of the crevice between the edges of the two
boards. From the nose of the first bar run a pair of very stout thongs
or else twisted sinew, which are drawn tight enough to prevent the nose
and curve from straightening out. From the end of the first
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page309" id =
"page309">309</a></span>
bar to the last one on the heel of the sled is run a stout twisted thong
under the end of each bar, which there has a notch cut on the under side
for the line to pass through. This line serves to strengthen the sides
and prevent the two boards from slipping past each other when passing
over inequalities of the ground. At the ends of the first bar and
connected with the side lines are two long stout thongs of twisted skin,
often 25 feet long. These are used as traces, by which the sled is
dragged. The shape of the bottom is often fashioned after all the
remainder of the work has been done. The width of the nose is rarely
more than 9 inches; at the first bar it is about 14 inches and as much
as 18 inches between the first and second bars. From the widest part to
the heel it gradually narrows to a width of 5 to 7 inches.</p>

<p>Two boards are used, as one of sufficient width could not be obtained
from the forests of that region. Besides, a&nbsp;single board would
certainly split, while two obviate this danger and render the sled less
stiff. In passing over rough places the sled must bend to conform to
inequalities or else it would break. In the construction of this vehicle
the Indian displays much skill and a perfect knowledge of the
requirements of the case. The load is placed so as to dispose the weight
on that portion which will bear chiefly on the ground. The great length
of the sled enables the person to guide it more readily.</p>

</div>

<p>The Nenenot are skilled in the manufacture and use of snowshoes, of
which four styles are used, viz: The “swallow-tail,” “beaver-tail,”
“round-end,” and “single-bar” (Figs. 128, 129). The frame is of wood,
nearly an inch wide and half an inch thick, usually in two pieces,
joined
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page310" id =
"page310">310</a></span>
by long lap splices wrapped with deerskin thongs, either at the sides or
ends of the shoe. In the single-bar shoe the frame is on one slip,
spliced at the toe. Birch is the favorite material for snowshoes, but is
rarely to be had except by those Indians who ascend the Koksoak to its
headwaters, so that spruce and larch are generally used.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the toe and heel bars of the snowshoes will be
best understood from the figures. They are usually placed within the
frame, and set in mortises in the inner side of the frame, before the
wrapping of the ends of the frames has been drawn together; otherwise
the bars could not be placed in the holes to receive them.</p>

<p>The netting is made of deerskin, with the hair removed, and allowed
to dry into a condition usually known as parchment. This is cut into
strips of variable width, depending on the particular use for which it
is wanted.</p>

<p>A needle of bone, horn, or iron (Fig. 130) is used for netting the
snowshoes. The shape of the implement is flat and rounded at each point,
to enable the needle to be used either backward or forward. The eye
which carries the line is in the middle. Various sizes of needles are
used for the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘dif-/erent’ at line break">different</ins> kinds of netting, of which the meshes
differ greatly in size.</p>

<p>The line is generally 10 to 20 feet in length, and when the netting
is completed it somewhat resembles the seating of a cane-bottomed chair.
Each individual varies his work according to fancy, but as the netting
between the bars is made of coarser line, more compactly woven, there is
less difference there than at the toe or heel.</p>

<p>The netting of the toe is of finer line and meshes than the middle or
between the bars; while that between the heel bar and heel of the
snowshoe is finest of all.</p>

<p>The netting between the bars holds the joints of the frames where
they lap over each other.</p>

<p>The toe and heel spaces of netting are held in place by the line
passing under the threads which are wrapped around the bars from the
netting between them, and again are fastened or slipped through loops of
thread or line which are let through the frame of the snowshoe.</p>

<p>Near the center of the toe-bar is a space left in the netting between
the bars to admit the toes of the wearer and allow them free action
while walking. This space is semicircular and is inclosed by several
strands of line passing over the toe-bar and forming loops, which have
the diagonal lines of the netting passed around them and drawn
tight.</p>

<p class = "caption">
NENENOT SNOWSHOE&mdash;“BEAVER-TAIL.”</p>

<p>The snowshoe is held to the foot by a wide buckskin thong attached at
the semicircular space back of the toe-bar. The ends must be far
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page311" id =
"page311">311</a></span>
enough apart to admit the width of the foot as far as the toes, and must
be then drawn down to prevent the foot from pushing too far forward and
striking against the toe-bar. The loop passing over the toes must be
slack enough to allow free movement of the foot. When the strap suits
the foot it is passed around the heel of the wearer and tied
sufficiently tight to give ease and comfort. If too tight, the weight
soon presses the tendon of the heel. If too loose, it drops down and the
toe slips from under the toe band.</p>

<p>The single-bar snowshoes are not much used, because they are somewhat
difficult to make. They are of two styles. One has the bar directly
under the center of the foot. It is wide, and should be strong enough to
sustain the weight of any wearer. The other style is where the single
bar is at the front of the toes, which pattern differs from the
“beaver-tail” style only in the absence of the heel bar. This pattern is
considered the easiest of all to wear and walk in when once learned. The
foot straps are exactly like those of the common kinds.</p>

<p>The single bar in the middle of the snowshoe renders it a matter of
great discomfort until one is accustomed to it, as the straps are simply
loops for the toe and heel. This pattern has been already figured. The
largest snowshoes measure as much as 28 inches across and 3 feet in
length.</p>

NENENOT SNOWSHOE&mdash;“ROUND-END.”</p>

<p>Some of the Indians acquire great expertness in the use of these
snowshoes, and are able to run quite rapidly with them. The width of the
shoes causes one to straddle widely to allow one snowshoe to pass above
and over the other. Care must be exercised that while bringing the rear
foot forward the frame does not strike the ankle and produce a serious
bruise. In ascending a hill the toe must elevate the snowshoe
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page312" id =
"page312">312</a></span>
to avoid a stumble. In descending the body must be thrown well back or a
pitch heels over head ensues, and sometimes the frames strike the back
of the head.</p>

<p>To put them on the feet the foot must enter the loop from forward
toward the rear, and when the loop is on the foot the latter must be
turned within the loop and then passed under the toe band.</p>

<p>Everybody wears snowshoes&mdash;men, women, and children. Without
them travel in winter would be an impossibility, and as the capture of
furs is made in winter and the ground to be hunted over must of
necessity be of great area, the snowshoe becomes a necessity as much as
the canoe in summer.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 131.</span>&mdash;Wooden snowshoe, Little
Whale river.</p>

<p>I collected two peculiar pairs of snowshoes, made of flat spruce
boards (Fig. 131). They are shaped exactly like netted snowshoes of the
“beaver tail” pattern, and the arrangement of the foot strap is the same
as usual.</p>

<p>They came from the Little Whale river Indians, who informed me that
they were worn on soft snow.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year, when the snow is rapidly melted by sun,
the netted snowshoes become clogged with slush, rendering the weight
very fatiguing. Wooden snowshoes are admirably adapted for that season
of the year, and may be made in a few hours, while the netted ones
require several days’ assiduous labor. The Indians of the Koksoak valley
do not use the wooden snowshoes.</p>


<h5><a name = "nene_weapons" id = "nene_weapons">
WEAPONS.</a></h5>

<p>In former times these Indians used the bow and arrow exclusively, but
they have now nearly discarded these weapons for the guns which they
procure from the traders.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">132.</ins></span>&mdash;Bow, Nenenot.</p>
</div>

<p>The bow and arrow is, however, still used to kill ptarmigan, hares,
and rabbits. The bow (Fig. 132) consists of a piece of larch or spruce
wood of 4 to 6 feet in length. It is only slightly narrower and thinner
at the ends, and nearly an inch thick and an inch and a half wide at the
central portions. But little ingenuity is displayed in the construction
of these weapons. They have considerable elasticity, and if broken it is
easy to obtain a piece of wood from the forest and fashion another. The
string is a strand of deerskin, twisted or rolled. It is rare to find a
bow that has a single string.</p>

<p>The arrows are usually 2 feet or 30 inches long, and feathered with
three ptarmigan feathers. (Figs. 133-136.) The head is usually an
egg-shaped knob, terminating in a slender point which soon breaks
off.</p>

<p>This weapon is used for small game, as the cost of ammunition is too
great to spend it upon game as readily procured
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page313" id =
"page313">313</a></span>
by this cheaper method. The Indian is very expert in the use of the bow
and arrow, and is able to knock over a ptarmigan or crouching hare every
time at 25 yards. The force with which the arrow is projected is
astonishing. I&nbsp;have seen a ptarmigan rolled for many yards amid a
perfect cloud of feathers when struck by the arrow. It often tears the
entire side out of the bird.</p>

<p>In former years the arrow did great execution among the deer in the
water or deep snow banks among which they floundered when driven into
them by the Indian who, on snowshoes, was able to travel where the deer
sank nearly out of sight.</p>

<p>Among the Indian boys it is yet a favorite amusement to shoot small
birds with the bow and arrow. Small crossbows also are used by children.
They have doubtless been made after those brought by some white man. The
children have great sport with these bows.</p>

<p>The spear, already referred to, for killing the swimming reindeer, is
shown in Fig. 137. The wooden shaft is 6 feet long, and the steel point,
which is made of a flat file beaten down to a quarter of an inch square,
is 11 inches long. It is set into the end of the shaft and <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘fastended’">fastened</ins> by a
whipping of sinew.</p>

<p>The weapon is held by the hand in a manner peculiar as well as
uncomfortable. The closed hand over the butt end of the weapon is so
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page314" id =
"page314">314</a></span>
placed as to have the fingers upward and the outside of the hand toward
the point, this rather awkward grasp enables the person to let go of the
weapon in case of threatened disaster resulting from a misdirected
thrust. The collection also contains three models of deer spears, Nos.
3205-3207. These are often also used as arrows to shoot at larger game
when the Indian is out hunting ptarmigan, hares, and rabbits.
A&nbsp;hungry wolverene or a famished wolf would prove troublesome to
kill with the blunt arrows. These models differ from the larger spear
only in size.</p>

</div>

<p>The Little Whale river Indians use a peculiar spear for killing white
whales. (Figs. 138, 139). It is modeled after the Eskimo harpoon, but
has no “loose shaft,” or rather, the fore shaft and loose shaft are in
one piece, and has a circular wooden disk fitted to the butt of the
shaft, which takes the place of the bladder float, and serves to impede
the motions of the animal when
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page315" id =
"page315">315</a></span>
struck. Reindeer antler is substituted for the ivory of the Eskimo
weapon. The blades are of copper or iron and riveted in. These spears
are 8 or 10 feet long.</p>

<p>The snare (Fig. 140) forms one of the less important methods of
procuring these animals. It is of parchment made from the skin of the
reindeer cut into thin narrow thongs. Several of these strands, usually
three, are plaited together to form a layer; and of these layers three
are plaited together to form the snare line. It often is made, however,
of three single strands cut somewhat wider and creased so that they will
lie well when the three are plaited. The more strands the greater the
flexibility of the line, but as there must be a certain amount of
stiffness to hold it in position the many strands must be woven more
tightly together. The length varies from 10 to 20 feet, and at the end
is a loop formed by turning the strands back and splicing them. Through
the loop the other end is passed, and the noose is made.</p>

Nenenot.</p>

<p>When a herd of deer is discovered in a favorable locality the people
of the vicinity are informed and hasty preparations are made.</p>

<p>The effort is to cause the deer to pass through a narrow defile
containing bushes. The snares are then placed in position by tying the
free end of the line to a suitable tree and suspending the noose where
the heads or antlers will become entangled. Some are placed so that when
the foot is lifted the noose is carried along and tightens on it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page316" id =
"page316">316</a></span>
<p>The people surround the animals, and at a given signal shout and
create the greatest din, to confuse the creatures, which plunge toward
the place where the snares are set. One or two hunters concealed in that
locality appear suddenly and further confuse the now panic-stricken
animals, which rush in every direction before their foes. They become
immeshed in the nooses and are held until their throats are cut or they
are choked by the cord.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that two deer will be caught in a single snare.
The Indians assert that it is a most ludicrous sight to witness two
sturdy bucks caught by the antlers in a single snare. They appear to
accuse each other of the misfortune, and struggle terribly to free
themselves. In the animals which are strangled by the noose the
congested blood distends the veins and renders the flesh very dark.</p>

<p>Previous to the general use of guns the snaring method was of greater
importance than at the present day. Even now the Indian does not lose
any opportunity of employing the snare.</p>

<p>Some of the snares are made of tanned skin, which is softer and is
often ornamented with strands of beads attached to the end of the line.
Some of them are colored red, with a mixture of vermilion and hematite
earths, thinned with water.</p>


<h5><a name = "nene_hunting" id = "nene_hunting">
HUNTING.</a></h5>

<p>I have already described the methods of hunting the reindeer and of
capturing small game.</p>

<p>The beaver is not plentiful in the Ungava district, and not until the
headwaters of the Koksoak and the lakes near the source of George’s
river are reached are they to be found at all, excepting occasional
stragglers.</p>

<p>The Indians have few of the skins of this animal to sell at the
trading post of Fort Chimo.</p>

<p>The methods of capture differ in some respects from those elsewhere
employed.</p>

<p>The habits of the beaver are so well known that a statement of their
manner of life is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The food supply north of latitude 55° is so limited in quality and
quantity that the scarcity of the animals is due entirely to the absence
of the food necessary for their existence.</p>

<p>When the dams and structures made by the beaver are discovered the
people devise means to capture it.</p>

<p>If it is convenient to get at the holes leading to the structure,
which are always under water so deep that it will not freeze to the
bottom, they are closed with a stick of wood and an opening made in the
top of the hut. The animal is then caught by the hind legs or tail and
lifted out. It seldom attempts to defend itself at first. As soon as the
hunter can do so he jerks the animal out, and with a blow on its head
kills it. If he should pause for an instant from the time the hand is
put on the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page317" id =
"page317">317</a></span>
animal until the death blow is given, that very instant he certainly
will be bitten with teeth so sharp and powerful that the fingers may be
snipped from the hand as though with a pair of shears. The wound thus
inflicted is often very severe and difficult to heal, as the bite is not
only cutting but crushing.</p>

<p>Where the water can be drained from the pond or lake in which the
beavers’ hut is built, the Indians often leave it high and dry by
damming off the supply and allowing the water to drain away. As soon as
the house is out of water the occupant emerges and is killed. Beavers
are sometimes shot while sporting on the water during moonlight
nights.</p>

<p>Some of the animals are captured by means of a net of peculiar
construction. This net is of fine deerskin thongs netted into a circle
nearly 2 feet in diameter, with meshes about an inch square. The meshes
in the outer row are threaded upon a stout thong of deerskin, in length
about four times the diameter of the net. This thong is now tied at the
ends, and over one end thus tied is slipped a ring made of spruce root
and wound with sinew to strengthen it. This ring is about an inch in
diameter, only sufficient to allow freedom of the ends of the line. It
is fastened to one of the meshes of the net in order to keep its
place.</p>

<p>Where the water is too deep and only a single beaver is in the lodge
the net is carefully spread over the mouth of the exit so placed as to
form a purse into which the head and neck of the animal will be thrust
as it leaves the hut. The mouth of the purse now tightens from the ring
slipping along the string, and thus strangles the animal or else causes
it to drown as it struggles to escape from the tightening cord.</p>

<p>The net is said to be a very effective means of capturing the beaver
and will succeed when it has become too wary to be shot on the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>The flesh of the beaver is considered valuable food by these people.
They prize it highly and prefer the flesh of the female to that of the
male.</p>

MISCELLANEOUS IMPLEMENTS, TOOLS, ETC.</a></h5>

<p>One of the most important tools used by the Nenenot is the “crooked”
knife (Fig. 141). These instruments are made from steel files or knife
blades. They are of various sizes depending on the amount of material at
hand. The Indian takes a piece of metal and grinds one side of it flat
and smooth; the other is edged like a drawing knife. The blade is now
heated and bent to the desired curve. Some are more bent than others and
some have only the point bent to one side. The few left-handed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page318" id =
"page318">318</a></span>
persons have the blade formed to suit themselves. It is set in a handle
curved from the user and bent upward like the blade. At the end of the
handle is generally to be found a thong on which a wooden button is
placed for attachment to the belt, as no man ever goes off on a journey
without this knife, however short may be the distance.</p>

<p>The handle is held in the hand at right angles or across the body and
invariable drawn toward the user. It is employed for all purposes of
whittling or shaving wood and one would be surprised to observe what
large strips will separate when started with this apparently frail
blade. The strips and slats of canoes, paddles, snowshoes, and in fact
everything that can be cut from wood, are made with this knife. It
requires much skill to guide the blade so as to cut the wood evenly; and
to this end the thumb, which is placed upon the outer extremity of the
handle, must steady the blade. The strain of the blade upon the handle
is very great, and it must be securely held by means of stout thongs
wrapped around it.</p>

<p>The crooked knife is a form of instrument in use among the Indians
and Eskimo alike, and one of the few implements which those widely
differing people have in common.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page319" id =
"page319">319</a></span>
<p>Awls (Fig. 142) are made of steel or iron. The back or spring of a
pocketknife or a portion of a small file appears to be the favorite
material for forming them. They are usually chisel-shaped and have
rectangular corners. The handle into which the metal is fastened is
generally of deer horn. The shape of the handle varies from a <span
class = "sans">Y</span> shape to that of a crescent.</p>

<p>These tools are constantly required for piercing holes in the various
woods used in manufacture. Articles of simple construction the Indian
prefers to make for himself, rather than pay an extortionate price to
the trader. He is able to accomplish remarkable results with rude tools
of his own make.</p>

<p>Snow shovels are made of wood and are much used, for during the
winter, when the snows are constantly accumulating around the camps, the
occupants necessarily remove some to form a pathway from the door of
their tent, and as snow forms an admirable protection, it is thrown or
banked up around their tents to prevent the wind from blowing under. In
the spring nearly all the aged people carry one of the wooden shovels to
clear away a path or as a help to walk while the slushy snow is so
treacherous. Fig. 143 represents a common form of wooden snow shovel.
These are often painted with vermillion or indigo.</p>

<p>Fig. 144 shows a special form of snow shovel designed for cleaning
the ice from the holes through which the people fish. It usually has a
blade made from the brow antler or one of the broad palms from the horns
of the reindeer. The horn portion is attached to the wooden shaft or
handle by means of thongs running through holes bored for that
purpose.</p>

<p>The ice-picks (Fig. 145) used in times gone by were pieces of
reindeer horn or bone, shaped like a narrow mortising chisel and
attached to staffs of wood. The chisel or pick was fastened to the staff
by means of stout thongs to prevent a side movement from the groove into
which it was set. The upper end of the staff was at times shod with bone
or horn so as to be available for a walking staff.</p>

<p>The ice-pick of the present day has a piece of iron or steel
substituted for the horn or bone; but, being heavy, it is not so often
carried from place to place. An Indian will in an incredibly short time
pierce a hole through 3 feet thickness of ice with it. A&nbsp;white man
can not equal them in this work.</p>

<p>Combs for the hair are purchased from the traders. They are highly
prized and are kept in little birchbark bags. For cleaning out the dirt
which collects on the comb the tail of a porcupine is used. The needles
or spines are picked out of the tail, leaving the stiff, coarse hairs,
which serve the purpose of cleaning the comb quite well. This tail is
usually appended to the comb-case.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page320" id =
"page320">320</a></span>
<p>The natives sometimes make wooden combs like the one shown in Fig.
146, in imitation of those purchased.</p>

<p>After a woman’s hair has been combed half of it is collected on each
side of the head and rolled or wound up on small pieces of board (Fig.
147) similar in shape to the “winders” on which darning or knitting cord
is wrapped. Strands of beads are now placed upon these to hold the hair
in place.</p>

AMUSEMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>The boys have no consideration for the females of their own age, but
treat them as inferiors and fit for nothing but to be subjects of almost
constant annoyance and persecution. When a number of boys collect they
are sure to maltreat the women, even those advanced in years, and appear
to delight in any opportunity to subject them to the rudest mischief. If
a woman ventures to peep from the tent in summer a shower
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page321" id =
"page321">321</a></span>
of water is sure to be flung on her by some boy. In winter snowballing
is equally annoying, and when parties of women go to the woods to get
fuel the pack of boys is sure to waylay them as they return. If the boys
can separate the women their fun is complete; their dresses are torn and
their bundles of fuel scattered. They often retaliate, however, and
strip the clothing from some unfortunate boy who is compelled to return
to camp in a nude condition, much to the amusement of the people. This
form of disgrace appears to be the most severe which can be inflicted
upon a male; and the jokes to which he is afterward subjected keep him
the object of ridicule for many days.</p>

<p>Besides practical jokes upon women, running, jumping, wrestling, and
practicing with the bow and other weapons suited to their age, appear to
be the principal amusements of the boys. The girls have never been
observed to play at games of any kind. Their chief occupation is to keep
away from the boys. While walking out the girls generally toss stones or
chips in the air and strive to keep at least two of them up at once. The
Eskimo often practice this also, and, as it appears to be a general
source of amusement among the Innuit, I&nbsp;suspect that the Indian
borrowed it from them. Wrestling appears to be the principal test for
physical strength and severe contests often engage the stronger
individuals. They wrestle in the Eskimo fashion, and frequently indulge
in trials of strength with these people. As would be expected, the
stronger Eskimo are always the victors. All these contests, whether
among themselves or with the Eskimo, are carried on with the best of
good humor.</p>

FESTIVALS.</a></h5>

<p>Feasts are given now and then to celebrate success in hunting and
similar achievements.</p>

<p>In 1883 I was invited to attend a feast of furs to be given by one of
the most energetic of the Indians. We repaired to the tents spread on
the top of a high wall of rock a few rods from my house. As I approached
the scene I observed a tent of different construction. It was nearly
oval at its base and had a diameter of about 18 feet and a length of
about 25 feet. The top was drawn to an apex resembling the common roof
of a house. The entrance to the structure faced southeast. On a pole,
supported with one end on the apex of the tent and the other resting on
a post, were numbers of skins of various animals&mdash;wolves,
wolverine, beaver, otter, foxes, and muskrat, together with a number of
the finest reindeer skins. The sound of the drum was heard within the
structure and as I approached the door the noise ceased. I&nbsp;paused
and was invited to enter. Immediately two old men next the drummer moved
to one side and motioned me to sit down on the pile of deerskins
reserved for me. It was evident that the feast had been in progress for
some time. Around the interior of the structure groups of men were idly
disposed, some reclining and others standing. Not a word was spoken for
some time, and this gave me opportunity to look around. The floor was
covered with boughs from the neighboring spruce trees, arranged with
unusual care, forming a soft carpeting for those seated within.
I&nbsp;saw a number of piles of deerskins and several small heaps
covered with cloth. To break the silence I inquired if the drum was
tired. A&nbsp;smile greeted the inquiry. Immediately an old man came
forward, tightened the snare of the drum, and arranged the string,
suspending it from one of the tent poles at the proper height for use.
He then dipped his fingers into a vessel of water and sprinkled a few
drops on the membrane of the drum-head to prevent it from breaking under
the blows to be delivered. The performer then seized the drumstick with
the right hand and gave the membrane a few taps; the transverse cord of
twisted sinew, holding the small cylinders of wood attached to it,
repeated the vibration with increased emphasis. A&nbsp;song was begun
and the drum beaten in <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘rythm’">rhythm</ins> to the monotonous chant of o-ho, o-ho, etc. Three
songs with tympanic accompaniment followed. The songs appeared alike and
were easily learned. In the meanwhile the guests were treated to a
strange-looking compound which had lain hidden beneath one of the cloths
and is known as “pemmican.” I&nbsp;was solicited to accept a piece. The
previously assembled guests had either brought their own bowls and
saucers to eat from or else appropriated those available. Not to be at a
loss, one of the young men remarked that he would find one. From among
the accumulated filth around one of the center poles supporting the
structure a bowl was produced. The man coolly took the handkerchief
which was tied around his forehead to keep his matted hair from his face
and wiped out the interior of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page323" id =
"page323">323</a></span>
bowl, and placing a piece of the pemmican within it, handed it to the
attendant whose duty it was to offer it to me.</p>

<p>I, however, found it quite inedible. Other guests constantly arrived
and some departed, made happy by their share of this compound of rancid
tallow and marrow with a due admixture of pounded dry meat of the
reindeer. I&nbsp;soon departed, and attempted to take the remnant of the
pemmican with me. This was instantly forbidden, and information given me
that by so doing I should cause all the deer to desert the vicinity, and
thus make the people starve. I&nbsp;explained that such was not my
desire, and after wishing continued prosperity and enjoyment,
I&nbsp;made my way out. I&nbsp;was then informed that the feast would
continue for a time, and wind up with an invitation to the women, who
had hitherto been excluded, to come and eat the remnants left by the
men. At the end of two days thereafter the feast concluded and a dance
took place. In this performance there was nothing remarkable. The men
sang songs and kicked up their heels, while the women shrugged their
shoulders as they swayed their bodies from right to left, and assumed
various other postures, although their limbs were apparently kept in a
rigid position, occasionally uttering their plaudits as the men made
humorous compliments to their generous host.</p>

<p>This feast was given by one who had been unusually successful in the
capture of fur-bearing animals, and, to prove his wealth, displayed it
before the assemblage and gave a feast in consideration of his ability.
Other feasts of a similar character occur, and differ from this in no
special feature.</p>

<p>The principal source of amusement with the men is the game of
draughts or checkers. While the men are in the tent or on the hillsides
awaiting the approach of bands of deer their idle moments are employed
over this game. Neither hunger nor the sight of game is sufficient to
distract them, so intently are they absorbed.</p>

<p>The game is played as in civilization, with only slight differences.
I&nbsp;am not aware that <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘wages’">wagers</ins> are laid upon its issue. Some of the men are so
expert that they would rank as skillful players in any part of the
world.</p>

<p>Small boards that may be carried in the hunting bag are used on trips
to while away the tedium of the long winter evenings with only the light
of the flickering fire of the dry limbs of spruce. Far into the night
the players engage, and are only disturbed when one of their tired
companions starts from his sleep to relate a wondrous dream and have it
expounded by the listeners, who sit aghast at the revelations.</p>

<p>They also have a game corresponding to “cup and ball,” but it is
played with different implements from what the Eskimo use, as may be
seen by referring to Fig. 150. The hollow cones are made from the
terminal phalanges of the reindeer’s foot. The tail tied to the end of
the thong is that of a marten or a mink. The player holds the peg in one
hand, and tossing up the bones tries to catch the nearest bone on the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page324" id =
"page324">324</a></span>
point of the peg. The object of the game is to catch the bone the
greatest possible number of times. It is in no sense a gambling
game.</p>

Nenenot.</p>

<p>The only musical instrument used by these people is the drum or
tambourine, which is of the form shown in Fig. 151. These drums vary in
diameter from 22 to 26 inches, and are constructed as follows: The
barrel is made of a thin slat of spruce, bent into a hoop, with the ends
joined in a lap, spliced nearly a foot long, which length is sewed by
four perpendicular seams. The stitches are made with deerskin thread put
through perforations, near together, made with an awl. The next
operation is to prepare for a head a thin reindeer skin, which has been
tanned. The skin is moistened and sewed so that all holes in it are
closed. A&nbsp;narrow hoop of a size to fit tightly over the barrel of
the drum is made and the moist skin stretched over it. The edges of the
skin are turned inward, and within this hoop is placed the barrel of the
drum.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page325" id =
"page325">325</a></span>
<p>A second hoop, two or three times as wide as the first, is prepared
and fitted over the barrel and head. It is pushed down as far as the
elasticity of the membrane will allow, or about half the width of the
top hoop. Through the outer hoop have been made a number of holes and
corresponding but alternate holes made in the farther edge of the barrel
of the drum.</p>

<p>Through these holes a stout thong is threaded and passing from the
edge of the barrel to the outer hoop is drawn so tightly as to push the
inner hoop along the outer circumference of the barrel and thus tighten
the membrane to the required degree. The outer hoop now projects an inch
or more beyond the membrane and thus protects it from injury by careless
handling.</p>

<p>Across the membrane is stretched a sinew cord on which are strung, at
right angles to the cord, a&nbsp;number of barrels made from the quills
of the wing feathers of the willow ptarmigan. Across the underside of
the membrane is stretched a similar cord with quills. These serve the
purpose of a snare on the drum. The stick used for beating the drum
consists of a piece of reindeer horn cut so as to have a thin and narrow
handle a foot in length and terminating in a knob more than an inch long
and as thick as the portion of horn permits. The drum is suspended from
the poles of the tent by means of thongs. The performer tightens the
snares, and sprinkles a few drops of water on the drumhead lest the
blows<ins class = "correction" title = "text has superfluous comma">&nbsp;</ins>cause it to split under the strain. Nothing is done,
nothing contemplated without sounding the drum. It is silent only when
the people are asleep or on a tramp from one locality to another.</p>

<p>If a person is ill the drum is beaten. If a person is well the drum
is beaten. If prosperous in the chase the drum is beaten; and if death
has snatched a member from the community the drum is beaten to prevent
his spirit from returning to torment the living.</p>

<p>The drumbeat is often accompanied with singing which is the most
discordant of all sounds supposed to be harmonious.</p>

<p>The drums used by the Little Whale river Indians (Fig. 152, No. 3223)
differs greatly in construction from those made by the Ungava Indians.
The size is rarely so great, seldom exceeding 22 inches. These drums
have two heads or membranes fitted on the barrel and secured by means of
a single hoop for each head. The two hoops are then connected by the
tightening strings.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page326" id =
"page326">326</a></span>
<p>The membranes are invariably made of deer skin in the parchment
condition and not of tanned skins. The snares or thongs across the heads
are finer and have pieces of wood instead of quills as “rattlers.” The
drumstick is a piece of reindeer horn cut as before described; or else,
as if to add to the din, a&nbsp;gun-cap box is pierced through from side
to side and a few pebbles or shot placed within. A&nbsp;stick is then
inserted in the hole through the box and the whole covered with buckskin
to prevent separation of the lid and box. This makes a distracting
noise.</p>

to a circular form and covered with two heads or membranes. Within it
are placed a few pebbles or shot, to produce a rattling sound when the

FOLKLORE.</a></h5>

<p>During the long winter nights or during the periods of cold or
inclement weather in which the Indians may not venture out, they sit
around the fire and relate stories intended for the instruction as well
as entertainment of the younger people. The older men have a great stock
of these stories, and many of the women are noted for their ability in
entertaining the children, who sit, with staring eyes and open mouth, in
the arms of their parents or elders.</p>

<p>The following stories came to me directly and not through the medium
of another white person, and probably I am the only white person who has
heard some of them. I&nbsp;have endeavored to give them as nearly in the
form of the original as the differences between the English and the
Indian languages will permit.</p>

Story of the wolverene and the brant.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A wolverene calling all the birds together addressed them thus: “Do
you not know that I am your brother? Come to me and I will dress you in
feathers.” After having dressed them up he made wings for himself and
said: “Now, brothers, let us fly.” The brant told the wolverene, “You
must not look below while we are flying over the point of land when you
hear a noise below. Take a turn when we take a turn.”</p>

<p>The first turn they took the wolverene did not look below, but at the
second turn they took, when they came over the point of land, the animal
looked below when he heard the noise of the shouting Indians and down he
came like a bundle of rags.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2"
href = "#note2">2</a></p>

<p>All the Indians ran up to him and exclaimed “There is a brant fallen
down.” One of the old Indian women got hold of him and began to pluck
his feathers off, then to disembowel him. She of course smelled the
horrible stench and exclaimed, “This goose is not fit to eat as it is
already rotten!” She gave the carcass to one of the children to throw
away. Another old woman came up and inquired, “Where did you throw the
brant goose to? How could it be rotten? It is not long since it was
killed.” The former old woman replied to her, “Go and see, if you do not
believe.” She went and found nothing but the dead wolverene.</p>

When the Indians perceive a flock of these brant they make a loud
clamor, which frightens the birds so much that they lose their senses,
fall to the ground and are thus killed. These birds are only seen in the
spring migrations and then in great multitudes, while in the fall it is
rare to see even a single individual, as they have a different return
route than in spring.</p>

Story of the wolverene.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A wolverene was running along the seashore and perceived a number of
geese, brant, ducks, and loons sitting in the water a short distance
off. The wolverene addressing them said, “Come here, brothers.
I&nbsp;have found a pretty bees’ nest. I&nbsp;will give it to you if you
will come on shore and have a dance.” All the birds went on land. The
wolverene said, “Let us have a dance and I will sing. Shut your eyes and
do not open them until we are done dancing<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.”</ins> He began to sing,
“A-ho´u-mu-hou-mu´-mu´-hŭm´.” The last word was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page328" id =
"page328">328</a></span>
so often repeated (accompanied with the act of the wolverene snipping
off the heads of the birds) that the loon opened one eye and saw the
headless ducks kicking. The loon ran to the water and exclaimed, “Our
brother has killed us!” The wolverene ran after the loon but the loon
dived under the water and came up a distance off and cried out,
“A&nbsp;ho ho ho ho ho ho!” The wolverene screamed, “Hold your tongue,
you red-eyed fowl.” The wolverene returned to where the ducks had been
killed; plucked their feathers off and cleaned them; put them into a
large kettle and boiled them.</p>

<p>While attending to the cooking he saw a whisky-jack (Us´ ka tcon)
(<i>Perisoreus canadensis</i>) flying about. The wolverene took a
firebrand and threw it at the bird, exclaiming, “You will be telling on
me, you long-tongued bird!” The jay flew away and told the Indians that
“Our brother (wolverene) has killed a lot of ducks and has them cooked,”
adding, “I&nbsp;think he is sleeping. I’ll show you where he is if you
will come.” The Indians replied, “We will go, for we are very hungry.”
They went and found the wolverene asleep alongside the pot. The Indians
ate all of the meat of the ducks. After they had finished the meat they
put the bones back into the kettle and went away. The wolverene awakened
after a time, took his dish and said to himself, “Now, I&nbsp;shall have
my dinner.” He poured all the broth into his dish and found nothing but
the bones remaining. In his surprise he said, “Surely, I&nbsp;have been
sleeping a long time; the meat is all boiled away.” The jay told him
that he had told the Indians. The wolverene said, “Why did you tell? you
stupid bird; I&nbsp;was keeping a nice piece of fat for you.<a class =

<p class = "footnote">

The jay is well known to be particularly fond of fat of any kind, hence
the tempting morsel withheld was a source for future reflection.</p>

The deer and the squirrel.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A reindeer called all the mammals and birds together and announced
that he would give names to all of them. When he came to name the
squirrel he inquired of the little creature what name it would prefer.
The squirrel replied that it would like to have the same name as the
black bear. The reindeer smiled and informed the squirrel that it was
too small to have the name of the bear. The squirrel began to cry and
wept so long that his lower eyelids became white.</p>

The young man who went to live with the deer.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A young man one morning told his old father that he had dreamed the
night before that a deer had asked him to come and live with them. The
old father replied, “That is a good sign; you will kill many deer after
that dream.” The young man went away to hunt, and while out he saw a
large herd of deer. A&nbsp;young doe from the band ran up toward him,
and he was about to fire at her when she said to him, “Do not fire, for
my father has sent me to you. Please put up your arrows.” She came
nearer and informed him that her father had sent her to ask him to come
and live with the deer forever.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page329" id =
"page329">329</a></span>
<p>The young man inquired, “How could I live with you when it is upon
deer that I live? I&nbsp;live in a tent and can not live outside.
I&nbsp;can not live without fire. I&nbsp;can not live without water.”
The doe replied, “We have plenty of fire, water, and meat; you will
never want; you will live forever. Your father will never want, as there
will be enough deer given to him.” The man consented to go with them.
The doe pointed to a large hill and said, “That is our home.” She told
him to leave his deerskin mantle, snowshoes, and arrows on the ground,
but to keep the bow. As they were walking along they came to a big
valley. She informed him that that was their path. The two went toward
the steep hillside and found the ground to be covered with deer. Some of
the deer were frightened when they saw the man coming, and started to
run. The doe’s father said to the frightened deer, “Do you not pity the
poor Indians who have to hunt for their living while we do not?” When
the young man and the doe came up, the father of the doe addressed the
young man, asking if he was hungry. The man replied, “Yes.” The father
then gave him a piece of nice meat and some fat. After the man had
finished eating the father inquired, “Is your father also hungry?” The
son replied, “Yes.”</p>

<p>The old buck informed the young man that they would give the son’s
father some deer to-morrow. After the young man had slept out one night
his father, in the morning, went out to look for his son, but found only
his mantle, snowshoes, and arrows, which had been cast aside the day
before, and also found the tracks in the valley leading to the home of
the deer under the hill. The old man returned to his tent and told the
other Indians that his son had gone away to live with the deer. The old
man then said, “Let us make snares and we will yet take him, as he can
not run as fast as the deer.” The Indians prepared a number of snare
nooses and went to the valley to set them among the bushes on the path.
The father of the young doe saw what was going on in the valley and told
the rest, “Let us go and give the old man some deer.” He told the young
man to come with them. The man replied that he could not accompany them,
as he would be left behind in no time while they were running. The old
buck instructed the young man to keep among the rest of the deer and he
would not be left behind them. All the deer then went out to the valley.
The young man kept among them; and as they were going through the bushes
he heard the shouts of the Indians who were concealed behind them. The
deer saw the snares and some of the animals fell into the nooses and
were caught. The remainder, with the young man, were soon beyond the
snares. The Indians began to kill the deer which had been taken in the
nooses, and when they had finished they found they had not captured the
young man. They consulted together and decided to search among the
tracks of the escaped deer to ascertain whether his foot-prints were
among them. They found his track and also the mark of his bow as he had
dragged it along in the snow.</p>

The wolf’s daughter going to seek her lover.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>An old mother wolf one morning said to her daughter, “You must go and
look for your lover or else we shall all starve to death, as your
brothers can not kill any deer.” The daughter inquired of her mother,
“Who is my lover?” The mother replied, “The otter is your lover. He
lives in the water. If you go to the narrows of the lake you will find
him.” The daughter said she would go. So early in the morning she
started off, and as she was going along the shore of the lake she saw an
open hole in the ice, and in the water the otter was sitting. The wolf
went up to the otter, but the otter swam away and was going to dive,
when the wolf said, “Do not dive and go away. My mother says you are my
lover.” The otter asked, “How can I be your lover when I live in the
water?” The wolf replied, “You can live on the land as well as in the
water.” The otter answered back, “I&nbsp;will not live on the land.” The
wolf retorted, “You will have to live on the land, and if you do not
come out I shall smother you in the water.” The otter said, “You can not
smother me, for I have a number of holes made in the lake ice.” The
otter dove into the water and disappeared. The wolf began to howl
dismally when the otter vanished. The wind began to blow and drifted the
snow furiously. The snow fell into the otter’s breathing holes and
filled them with slushy snow, which soon froze and completely stopped
all the holes in the ice but one where the wolf was sitting. This hole
was kept clear of snow and ice by the wolf scraping it out as fast as it
collected. Soon she heard the otter going to the holes for breath, but
when he came near the hole where the wolf was sitting she could hear him
snuffing for air, and she stood with open jaws ready to seize him when
he should appear. The otter was nearly exhausted, so the wolf went off a
little distance, and the otter came up to the surface of the water
nearly out of breath. He crept out of the water and rolled himself in
the dry snow to take the water off of his coat of fur and exclaimed to
the wolf, “I&nbsp;will live with you; I&nbsp;will live with you.” The
wolf then addressed her lover and said, “Did I not tell you I would
smother you?” The otter did not reply to this, but asked her, “Have you
got a piece of line? Give it to me, and I will go to catch some fish for
you if you will go and prepare a tent.” The wolf drew out a piece of
fishing line and handed it to the otter. The otter went down into the
same hole in the ice whence he had come. He was gone some time, and in
the meantime the wolf was busy making the tent, which was completed
before the otter returned. Soon after, however, the otter came back to
the hole with a long string of fish which he had killed and had them all
strung on the line. He left the string of fish in the hole in the ice
with one end of it fastened to the ice. The otter rolled himself in the
snow to remove the water from his fur, and then went to the tent to tell
his wife to go and get the fish which he had left in the hole in the
ice.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page331" id =
"page331">331</a></span>
The wolf went and hauled up the line, which was full of fish, and began
to devour so many that soon she could scarcely move. She hauled the
remainder of the fish home to the tent.</p>

<p>The otter was sleeping when she returned. She proceeded to clean the
fish and put on a large kettle full of the fish to boil for supper. She
then crept into bed with her husband, and the next morning she was
delivered of a young otter and a young wolf. After the father and mother
had taken their breakfast the latter sat with her head hanging down and
seemed to be in a miserable mood. The otter inquired of the wife wolf,
“What is the matter with you that you sit so quietly?” The wolf
answered: “I&nbsp;wish I had some deerskins with which to make clothing
for the children. How nicely I should dress them!” The otter replied:
“Open the door and I will show you where I get the deer.” It was yet
early, and the otter went away to seek the deer. The otter saw a band of
thirty deer, but had no gun with which to kill them, so he frightened
them, and as they were running away he sprang at them each, and jumped
through them from end to end. He killed all of them in this manner and
then rolled in the snow to cleanse himself. After that was done he
wended his way home, and on arriving informed his wife (for it was then
a little after sunset) that on the morrow she should go to bring home
the deer he had killed, adding that she could follow his track, and thus
find them. The wife had a big pot of fish cooked for him when he
returned, and when he had finished his supper he went to bed. As soon as
the wife suspected her husband to be asleep she went after the deer, and
by hauling four at a time she soon had them all brought, and laid them
before the tent. When that was finished she went to bed. In the morning
the otter told her to get up and make a fire, as she would have to go
for the carcasses of the deer which he had killed the day before. The
wife replied: “I&nbsp;have already brought them all home.” The otter
asked her: “How could you bring them home in the dark?” The wife
answered: “Look out through the door if you do not believe me.” The
otter looked and saw the thirty deer all piled up before the door. He
turned and looked at his wife, but made no remark. The wolf asked him:
“Why do you look at me, so hard?” The otter said: “I&nbsp;was wondering
how you could get them home in such a short time.” The wolf said: “Come,
and take your breakfast, for you will have to help me skin the deer.”
After they had finished eating their breakfast they began to skin the
deer, and soon had them done. The wolf told her husband to make a stage
or scaffold for the meat, adding that she would clean the skins. The
otter prepared the stage, which in a short time was completed. The meat
was placed on the stage and the skins hung up to dry around the tent.
They then went in to take their supper. The wife was not in a talkative
mood, and soon went to bed. The next morning the wolf hung her head
down, and the otter seeing her again in such mood, inquired what was the
matter with her that she should be so quiet.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page332" id =
"page332">332</a></span>
The wolf replied: “I&nbsp;am thinking of my poor father and mother and
brothers; I&nbsp;suppose they will all be starved to death. My old
father told me to tell you to put a mark on the middle of the lake so
they would know where I am.” The otter went to the middle of the lake
and erected a pile as a mark by which the wolf’s relations should know
it. The brothers of the otter’s wife were on the hill looking for the
mark set up by their sister’s husband, and when they saw it they
exclaimed: “Our sister has saved us! our sister has saved us!” and ran
back to their old father’s home to give him the joyful intelligence that
they had seen the mark put up by the husband of their sister. The old
wolf then told his family that they would go and seek their sister and
daughter to live with her and her husband. They all went to the hill by
the lake, and from the top of it they saw the mark, and from it they
followed the track of the otter until they saw the tent in the edge of
the woods. They exclaimed: “There is our sister’s tent, for the
deerskins are hanging outside.” They raised such a joyful shout at the
prospect before them, that the noise frightened some young otters (for
the family had now become larger) which were playing outside. The little
ones scampered in and hid themselves behind their father’s back. The
father inquired, “What is the matter, that you are so frightened?” The
little ones replied: “We are running from the Hunger” (for that was the
name they applied to the wolves). The mother replied: “Perhaps they see
my father, mother, and brothers coming.” The otter told his wife to go
out and see. She complied, and when she opened the door they saw a row
of gaunt wolves; nothing but skin and bones. The newcomers immediately
fell to, and began to devour the meat which was on the stage. The
otter’s wife remonstrated, and said: “Do not be so greedy; my husband is
not a stingy man. I&nbsp;take my meals when he is sleeping, and pretend
not to eat much during the day.” They all went into the tent and the
otter soon went to bed. When they thought he was asleep, they began to
eat all the raw meat and fish, and soon finished it. In the morning when
the otter had awakened, he remarked to his wife: “I&nbsp;think your
brothers will make a fool of me.” The wife asked: “What makes you think
so?” The otter replied: “They look at me so hard, that I do not know
where to turn my eyes.” After breakfast the otter and his wolf brothers
went away to look for deer. They soon came upon a band of them, and the
otter told the wolves to go and kill them. The wolves ran after the
deer, but got only one of them. After the deer were frightened by the
wolves, the otter sprang after the deer and soon killed every one of
them in the same manner he had killed the others. He then cleaned
himself in the dry snow and returned home. The wolves had started for
the tent before the otter, so when the latter returned they asked the
otter: “How many deer did you kill?” The otter replied: “I&nbsp;killed
all that were in the band,” adding, “In the morning you will have to go
for the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page333" id =
"page333">333</a></span>
deer.” So everything was got ready for an early start and they all
retired to bed. When they awakened in the morning, one of the wife’s
brothers said to another: “Look at our otter brother; he has a white
mouth.” The otter turned to his wife and said to her: “Did I not tell
you that your brothers would make a fool of me?” The otter then took his
two otter children in his arms, and told his wife that she would have to
make her living as best she could, as he would not live with her any
more, that he was going away to leave her. He darted off to the lake,
and disappeared under the ice, and was never seen again.</p>

The devil punishing a liar.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A bear (mackwh) had two young cubs which she did not want to let know
that summer had come, but kept them in the den and would not let them go
out. The young ones continually inquired if the summer had come, and
repeated the question every time the mother returned from the outside.
She invariably answered, “No.” Some days after she fell asleep, when she
had returned from one of her trips, and while sleeping her mouth opened
wide. The young ones said to each other: “Surely the summer is come, for
there are green leaves in our mother’s mouth.” The mother had told her
children how beautiful was the summer time, how green the trees, how
juicy the plants, and how sweet the berries; so the cubs, impatient,
while longing for summer that they might enjoy what was outside of their
den, knew by the leaves in their mother’s mouth that she had deceived
them. The older cub told the younger that they would slip out at the top
of the den and go out while their mother was yet sleeping. They crept
out and found the weather so fine and the surroundings so pleasant that
they wandered some distance off by the time she wakened from her sleep.
She ran out and called loudly for her children, seemingly surprised, and
exclaimed: “My sons, the summer has come; the summer has come.” The cubs
hid when they heard their mother’s voice. She called to them until
nightfall. The older cub said to his brother: “I&nbsp;wish the devil
(A-qan´) would hear her and kill her for telling us the summer had not
come, and keeping us in the house so long when it was already pleasant
outside.”</p>

<p>The mother bear soon screamed to her sons: “The devil has heard me
and is killing me.”</p>

<p>The cubs heard the devil killing their mother with a stone, pounding
her on the head.</p>

A wolverene destroys his sister.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A wolverene having wandered far, for several days without food,
suddenly came upon a bear. The former, feeling very hungry, conceived
the plan of destroying his larger prey by stratagem. The wolverene
cautiously approached the bear and exclaimed: “Is that you, sister?” The
bear turned around and saw the wolverene, but in a low tone, which the
wolverene did not hear, said to herself: “I&nbsp;did not know that I had
a brother,” so ran quickly away.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page334" id =
"page334">334</a></span>
The wolverene continued to scream: “Come here, sister, our father has
sent me to look for you. You were lost when you were a little girl out
picking berries.” Thus spoken to, the bear approached the supposed
brother, who informed her that he knew of a place, on the hill there,
where a lot of nice berries were ready for eating, saying: “Do you not
see the berries growing on that hill, sister?” The bear answered:
“I&nbsp;cannot see so great a distance.” So the two went up the hillside
where the berries grew. When they arrived at the place, and it was some
distance off, the bear asked: “How is it that your eyes are so good?”
The wolverene replied: “My father mashed a lot of cranberries into my
eyes and put me into a sweat house.” The bear said: “I&nbsp;wish my eyes
were as good as yours.” The wolverene answered: “I&nbsp;will make your
eyes as good as mine if you will gather a lot of cranberries while I
prepare a sweat house.” The bear went to gather berries while the other
prepared the house during her absence. The wolverene selected a stone
having a sharp edge, which she concealed under the moss in the sweat
house, while she procured a larger stone for the pillow.</p>

<p>After the sweat house was completed the wolverene cried out: “Sister,
the sweat house is finished!” The bear returned, bringing a quantity of
berries. They both went into the sudatory, whereupon the wolverene
instructed the bear to lie with her head upon the stone pillow, while he
prepared the crushed berries to put in her eyes. He then said to her:
“Now, sister, do not move; you may find the berries will hurt the eyes
and make them very sore, but they will be better soon.” The wolverene
filled the bear’s eyes full of the sour berries, which made her exclaim:
“Brother, they are making my eyes very sore.” The wolverene answered:
“You will find them the better for that. After I get your eyes full of
the berries I will blow my breath on them.” After the eyes of the bear
were full of berries the wolverene said: “You are too good to be a
sister,” so he struck her on the head with the sharp-edged stone and
cleft her skull between the eyes and killed her.</p>

The rabbit and the frog.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>One day a rabbit was wandering among the hillsides, and at a short
distance from him he observed a tent belonging to some Indians. Being
timid he crept up to the side of the tent and peeped through a small
hole, and saw inside of it a frog sitting near the fire. The rabbit
seeing no danger accosted the frog thus: “Brother, what are you doing?”
The frog replied: <ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“I</ins>&nbsp;am playing with the ashes. My brothers have gone
off hunting and I am here as I have a very sore leg and can not go far.”
The rabbit rejoined, “come with me and I will keep you?” The frog
answered, “I&nbsp;can not walk as my leg is too sore.” The rabbit
offered to carry the frog on his back. The rabbit took the frog and
giving him a toss threw him on his back and said: “This is the way I
will carry you.” So they started for the home of the rabbit, where, upon
arriving, the rabbit
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page335" id =

placed the frog inside of the tent while the former went out to look for
something to eat. While seeking food the rabbit suddenly spied a smoke
curling from among the willows which grew along the branch of the creek.
He became frightened and started to run homeward exclaiming,
“I&nbsp;have forgotten my crooked knife and I must go quickly to get
it.” (This part, or what the rabbit says to himself, is sung as a song;
with an attempt at imitation of the rabbit’s voice.) The rabbit ran
hurriedly home and sprang into the tent, whereupon the frog observing
the fright of the other inquired, “Brother, what is the matter that you
are so excited?” The rabbit answered, “I&nbsp;saw a large smoke.” “Where
is it?” inquired the frog. The rabbit replied, “It is from among the
willows along the creek that runs near by.” The frog began to laugh at
the foolish fear of the rabbit and answered him that the smoke proceeded
from the lodge of a family of beavers, and taunted the rabbit for being
afraid of such a timid creature as a beaver when they are good to eat,
adding that his own (frogs) brothers often carried him to the beavers’
houses to kill them when they were out of food; although his brothers
could never kill any of them.</p>

<p>The rabbit was pleased to hear the frog was such a great hunter, and
gladly offered to carry the frog to the lodge of the beavers that some
food could be procured. The frog accepted the offer and was carried to
the creek bank. The rabbit then built a dam of stakes across the stream
and below the lodges in order that the beavers should not escape. The
frog then directed the rabbit to break into the top of the lodge so that
the frog might get at the beavers to kill them. While the rabbit was
breaking into the lodge of the beavers, the frog purposely loosened some
of the stakes of the weir below in order to allow the beavers to escape,
hoping that the rabbit would become angry at him for so doing. When the
rabbit saw what mischief the frog had done, he took the frog and roughly
shoved him under the ice into the water. This did not harm the frog as
it could live under water as well as on land, but the rabbit did not
know that, so he believed he had drowned his brother the frog. The
rabbit then returned to his home, regretting he had acted so harshly and
began to cry for his brother. The frog in the meanwhile, killed all of
the beavers and tied them together on a string, then slowly crawled to
the rabbit’s home with his burden on his back. The frog crept up to the
tent but was afraid to enter so he began to play with the door flap of
the tent to make a noise to attract the attention of the rabbit within.
Finally he cried out to the rabbit, “Brother, give me a piece of fire
for I am very cold.” The rabbit did not recognize the tired, weak voice
of his brother frog, and, afraid lest it be some enemy endeavoring to
entice him from his home, picked up a piece of dead coal which had no
fire on it and flung it outside. The frog then said, “Brother, there is
no fire on this piece and I can not cook my beavers with it.” The rabbit
then ran out quickly and tenderly carried the frog inside, and
immediately the latter
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page336" id =
"page336">336</a></span>
began to moan and appear to suffer so much that the rabbit inquired what
was the matter and asked if the beavers had bitten him. The frog said,
“No, it was you who gave me such a hard push that you have hurt me in
the side.” The rabbit assured the frog that the injury was
unintentionally caused. The frog then directed the rabbit to prepare and
cook the beavers. The rabbit went out to fetch them but he began to eat
and did not stop until they were all devoured. After having finished
eating them the rabbit went for a walk. Ere long he noticed a huge smoke
curling from the farther end of a valley and becoming greatly frightened
he exclaimed, “I&nbsp;have forgotten my crooked knife and I must go
quickly to get it.” He dashed into his door in a terrible state of mind.
The frog coolly inquired, “What is the matter that you are so scared?”
The rabbit said, “I&nbsp;have seen a great smoke at the farther end of
the valley through which the creek runs.” The frog laughed loudly at his
fear and said, “They are deer; my brothers often had me to kill them, as
they could not kill any, when we had no meat.” The rabbit was delighted
at that so he offered to carry the frog toward the place. The frog
directed the rabbit to make a snowshoe for the one foot of the frog. The
rabbit soon had it made and gave it to his brother. The frog then said,
“Carry me up towards the smoke.” The rabbit slung the frog on his back
and away they went in the direction of the deer. The frog then told the
rabbit to stand in one place and not to move while he (the frog) would
work at the deer, and when he had finished he would call him up to the
place.</p>

<p>The frog killed all the deer in a very short time, skinned them, and
stuck the head and neck of one of the deer into the snow so that it
would be looking toward the place whence the rabbit would come. The frog
then took the lungs of one of the deer and put it out to freeze. The
cold turned the lungs white as tallow. The frog shouted for his brother
rabbit to come quickly. When the rabbit came bounding near he saw the
eyes of the deer’s head staring at him in a queer manner; he was so much
alarmed that he exclaimed to the frog, “Brother, he sees me.” The frog
smiled and said, “I&nbsp;have killed him; he is dead; come on;
I&nbsp;have a nice piece of fat saved for you.” (It&nbsp;was the frozen
lungs of the deer.) So he gave the rabbit a large piece and told him to
eat it all and quickly, as it was better when frozen and fresh from the
deer’s back. The rabbit greedily swallowed large portions and did not
observe the deception. After a time they built a lodge or tent for the
night. Some few hours after the tent was made the frozen deer lungs
which the rabbit had eaten began to thaw and it made the rabbit so
violently ill that he vomited continually the entire night. The frog had
served him this trick as a punishment for having eaten all of the beaver
meat two days before.</p>

The wolverene and the rock.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A wolverene was out walking on the hillside and came upon a large
rock. The animal inquired of the rock, “Was that you who was walking
just now?” The rock replied,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page337" id =
"page337">337</a></span>
“No, I&nbsp;can not move; hence I can not walk.” The wolverene retorted
that he had seen it walking. The rock quickly informed the wolverene
that he uttered a falsehood. The wolverene remarked, “You need not speak
in that manner for I have seen you walking.” The wolverene ran off a
little distance and taunted the rock, challenging it to catch him. The
wolverene then approached the rock and having struck it with his paw,
said, “See if you can catch me.” The rock answered, “I&nbsp;can not run
but I can roll.” The wolverene began to laugh and said, “That is what I
want.” The wolverene ran away and the rock rolled after him, keeping
just at his heels. The animal finally began to tire and commenced to
jump over sticks and stones until at last the rock was touching his
heels. At last the wolverene tripped over a stick and fell. The rock
rolled over on him and ceased to move when it came upon the hind parts
of the wolverene. The animal screamed, “Get off, go away, you are
hurting me; you are breaking my bones.” The rock remained motionless and
replied, “You tormented me and had me run after you, so now I shall not
stir until some one takes me off.”</p>

<p>The wolverene replied, “I have many brothers and I shall call them.”
He called to the wolves and the foxes to come and remove the rock. These
animals soon came up to where the rock was lying on the wolverene and
they asked him, “How came you to get under the rock?” The wolverene
replied, “I&nbsp;challenged the rock to catch me and it rolled on me.”
The wolves and foxes then told him that it served him right to be under
the rock. They endeavored, after a time, to displace the rock but could
not move it in the least. The wolverene then said, “Well, if you cannot
get me out I shall call my other brother, the lightning and thunder.” So
he began to call for the lightning to come to his aid. In a few moments
a huge dark cloud came rushing from the southwest, and as it hurried up
it made so much noise that it frightened the wolves and foxes, but they
asked the lightning to take off the coat of the wolverene but not to
harm, his flesh. They then ran away. The lightning darted back to gather
force and struck the rock, knocking it into small pieces and also
completely stripped the skin from the back of the wolverene, tearing the
skin into small pieces. The wolverene stood naked, but soon began to
pick up the pieces of his coat and told the lightning, “You need not
have torn my coat when you had only the rock to strike.”</p>

<p>The wolverene gathered up his pieces of coat and said he would go to
his sister, the frog, to have her sew them together. He repaired to the
swamp where his sister dwelt and asked her to sew them. She did so. The
wolverene took it up and told her she had not put it together properly
and struck her on the head and knocked her flying into the water. He
took up the coat and went to his younger sister, the mouse. He directed
her to sew his coat as it should be done. The mouse began to sew the
pieces together and when it was done the wolverene carefully examined
every seam and said, “You have sewed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page338" id =
"page338">338</a></span>
it very well; you will live in the tall green grass in the summer and in
grass houses in the winter.” The wolverene put on his coat and went
away.</p>

Creation of people by the wolverene and the muskrat.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>As a wolverene was wandering along the bank of a river he saw a
muskrat swimming in the edge of the water. He accosted the latter animal
with the inquiry, “Who are you? Are you a man or a woman?” The muskrat
answered, “I&nbsp;am a woman.” The wolverene informed her that he would
take her for a wife. The muskrat replied, “I&nbsp;live in the water; how
can I be your wife?” The wolverene told her that she could live on the
land as well as in the water. The muskrat went up on the bank to where
the wolverene was standing. They selected a place and she began to
prepare a home for them. They ate their suppers and retired. Soon after
a child was born. The wolverene informed his wife that it would be a
white man and father of all the white people. When this child was born
it made a natural exit. In due time a second child was born which the
wolverene decreed should be an Indian and the father of their kind. This
child was born from its mother’s mouth. After a time a third child was
born, and the wolverene announced it to be an Eskimo and father of its
kind. This child was born <i>ab ano</i>. In the natural course of events
a fourth child was born, and the wolverene decided it to be an Iroquois
and father of its kind. This child was born from its mother’s nose.
After a time a fifth child was born and the wolverene decreed it should
be a Negro and father of its kind. This child was born from its mother’s
ears. These children remained with their parents until they grew up.
Their mother then called them together and announced to them that they
must separate. She sent them to different places of the land, and, in
parting, directed them to go to the white men whenever they were in need
of anything, as the whites would have everything ready for them.</p>

The Indian and his beaver wife.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>One day an Indian was hunting along the bank of a stream and in the
distance saw a beaver’s house. In a moment he perceived a beaver
swimming toward him. He drew up and was on the point of shooting it when
the animal exclaimed, “Do not shoot, I&nbsp;have something to say to
you.” The Indian inquired, “What is it you have to say?” The beaver
asked him, “Would you have me for a wife?” The Indian replied,
“I&nbsp;can not live in the water with you.” The beaver answered, “You
will not know you are living in the water, if you will follow me.” The
Indian further remarked that he could not live on willows and other
woods like a beaver. The beaver assured him that when eating them he
would not think them to be willows. She added, “I&nbsp;have a nice house
to live in.” The man replied, “My brother will be looking for me if I
come in and he will not know where I am<ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing">.”</ins> The beaver directed the man to take off
his clothing and leave them on the bank and to follow her. The Indian
did as he was instructed. As he was wading through the water he did not
feel the water touching him; so they presently began to swim and soon
reached the home of the beaver. The beaver told him as she pointed
ahead, “There is my home, and you will find it as good and comfortable
as your own tent.” They both entered and she soon set before him some
food which he did not recognize as willow bark. After they had slept two
nights his brother became alarmed and went to search for him, and soon
found his track. In following it up his brother came to where he had
left his clothing on the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>The brother was distressed at finding such things, so went
sorrowfully back to the tent thinking that his brother had been drowned,
and so told the other Indians when he arrived. With a heavy heart he
went to bed and in the morning he awakened and told his wife that he had
dreamed his brother was living with a beaver. He told his wife to make
some new clothing for the lost brother as he would go and seek the
haunts of the beavers to discover his brother. The man occupied himself
in making a pair of snowshoes, while the wife prepared the clothing. The
next day she had the clothing done and he directed her to make them into
a small bundle as he would start on the search early the next morning.
Other young men desired to accompany him on the search, but were advised
to remain at home as their presence would prevent him from reaching the
beaver’s retreat. Early in the morning he started off, taking the
clothes and snowshoes with him. After some time he found the place where
the beaver had her house and in which he suspected his brother to be
living. He went to work to make a dam across the stream so as to
decrease the depth of water around the beaver’s house. The wife had
borne two children to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page340" id =
"page340">340</a></span>
husband by this time, and when the father had seen the water going from
their house he told the children: “Your uncle is coming and he is
certain to kill you.” The water had soon gone down sufficiently to
enable the man to cross the stream to where the house was situated.</p>

<p>On arriving there he began pounding at the mud walls. The father told
the children to go out or else the house would fall on them. The man
outside quickly killed the two young ones. The wife knew she would soon
be killed also, and after they had heard the deathblows given to their
children she said to her husband, “If you are sorry that I am killed and
ever want to see me again, keep the right hand and arm of my body; take
off the skin and keep it about you.” In a few minutes the brother had
begun again to tear out the sides of the lodge. The husband told her to
go out, and that his love for her would make him keep her right hand.
She then went out and was quickly killed with a stick. When this was
done and the husband had heard it all he was very sorry for his wife.
Again the man began to destroy the rest of the house and soon had a
large hole in the wall of one side. The husband then said to him, “What
are you doing? You are making me very cold.” The brother replied,
“I&nbsp;have brought some warm clothing for you and you will not feel
cold.” “Throw them in,” said the husband, “for I am freezing.” He put on
the clothes, and while he was doing it the brother noticed the hairs
which had grown on the other’s back, but said nothing about it. The
husband then sat in his house until the other was near freezing to
death. The brother then said to him, “Come with me; you can not stay
here.” The husband demanded, as a condition of returning, that the
brother should never say anything to him to make him angry if he went
back. The brother promised him not to do so. They then started to
return, the brother taking the bodies of the children and mother on his
back, the husband walking ahead. They soon arrived at the home of their
people. The brother threw down the beavers and directed his wife to skin
them. The husband of the beaver asked for the right hand and arm of the
beaver who had been his wife. It was given to him. He got one of the
other women to skin it, and told her to dry the skin and return it to
him. Three nights after their return to their people a great many
beavers were killed and a large kettle full of flesh was boiled for
food. The people pressed the runaway brother to eat of the flesh of the
beavers. He informed them that if it was the flesh of a female beaver he
would not eat it. They told him that the flesh of the male beavers was
all finished long ago. They forced him to eat a large piece of meat, and
when he had swallowed it they gave him more of it. The second piece was
no sooner down his throat than a large river gushed from his side. The
Indian jumped into the river, while the rest ran away in terror and, as
these latter looked down the river, they saw the man swimming by the
side of his wife who had been a beaver.</p>

<p>A hare, which had lost his parents, lived
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page341" id =
"page341">341</a></span>
with his grandmother. One day, feeling very hungry, for they were
extremely poor, he asked his grandmother if he could set a net to catch
fish. The old woman laughed at the idea of a hare catching fish, but to
humor him, she consented, for she was indulgent to him because he was
her only charge and looked forward to the time when he should be able to
support her by his own exertions, and not to rely on the scanty supplies
which she was able to obtain. These were very meager, as she was infirm,
and dreaded exposure. She then told him to go and set the net, but added
that she had no fire to cook them with, even if he should catch any. The
hare promised to procure fire if he caught the fish. He went to set the
net in a lake where he knew fish to be plentiful. The next morning he
went to the net and found it to be so full of fish that he was unable to
take it up. He lifted one end and saw there was a fish in every mesh of
the net. He shook out some of the fish and then drew out the net. Part
of the fish were buried, and a large load taken home. He put the fish
down outside of the tent, and went in. He told the old woman to clean
the fish and that he would go across the river to the Indians’ tent and
get the fire with which to cook them. The old woman was speechless at
such proposed rashness, but as he had been able to catch so many fish
she refrained remarking on his contemplated project of obtaining fire in
the face of such danger. While the old woman was cleaning the fish he
went back after the net which he had put out to dry on the shore of the
lake.</p>

<p>He folded it up, placed it under his arm, and ran to the edge of the
river which was far too wide to jump over. He used his cunning and
assembled a number of whales. These animals came puffing up the stream
in obedience to his command. He ordered them to arrange themselves side
by side across the stream so that he could walk across on their backs.
He most dreaded the Indians, but jumped into the water to wet his fur.
This being done he sprang from one whale to another until he was safe on
the opposite shore. He then laid down in the sand and bade the whales to
disperse. Some Indian children soon came playing along the sandy bank
and saw the hare lying there. One of the children picked up the hare and
started home with it. When the boy arrived and told how he had obtained
the hare he was directed to put it in the iron tent (kettle) where there
was a bright fire crackling.</p>

<p>The child put down the hare, upon which an old man told the boy to
kill the hare. The hare was terribly frightened, but opened a part of
one eye to ascertain whether there was any place of exit beside the
door. In the top of the tent he observed a large round hole. He then
said to himself: “I&nbsp;wish a spark of fire would fall on my net.”
Instantly the brands rolled and a great spark fell on the net and began
to burn it. The hare was afraid of the fire, so he sprang out of the
hole in the apex of the tent. The Indians saw they had been outwitted by
a hare,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page342" id =

and began to shout and pursue the animal, which attained such speed that
when he came to the bank of the river he had not time to recall the
whales. He gave an extraordinary leap and cleared the entire expanse of
the water. He examined the net and found the fire smouldering. On
arrival at his own home he said to his grandmother: “Did I not tell you
I would get the fire?” The old woman ventured to inquire how he had
crossed the river. He coolly informed her that he had jumped across.</p>

The spirit guiding a child left by its parents.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>An Indian and his wife had but one child, which was so infested with
vermin that when the parents contemplated going to the tents of some
distant friends the father advised the mother to leave the child behind.
The next morning after the mother had taken down the tent the little boy
asked her “Mother, are you not going to put on my moccasins?” the mother
replied, “I&nbsp;shall put them on after I have put on my snow-shoes.”
The little boy said, “Surely you are not going to leave me!” She said,
“No;” but took hold of her sled and started off. The little boy cried
out, “Mother, you are leaving me,” and endeavored to overtake her in his
bare feet; but the mother soon was out of sight. The little boy began to
cry and retraced his steps to the tent place. There he cried until the
spirit of a dead man came to him and asked, “Where is your mother?” The
boy replied, “She has gone away and left me.” “Why did she leave you?”
asked the old man. “Because I was so covered with lice,” replied the
boy. The spirit said it would remove all of the lice but three. So it
began to pick them off. After this was done the spirit asked, “Where did
your mother go?” The boy pointed out her track. The spirit then said to
the boy, “Would you like to go to your mother?” The boy answered, “Yes.”
The spirit put the boy on his back and started in the path made by the
sled of his mother. After a while they came to a tree and in looking at
it the boy saw a porcupine sitting among the branches. The boy greatly
desired to have the animal. So he said, “Grandfather, I&nbsp;wish you
would kill the porcupine.” The old man answered, “It will make too much
smoke for me to kill it.” After a time they came across a hare which the
boy again desired to have. To this the man assented. So he put the boy
down in the snow and soon caught the hare and killed it. It was now
becoming dark, so they made their camping place for the night. The
spirit gave the boy the hare and told him to cook it. After the meat was
cooked the boy asked the old man what parts of the animal he preferred.
The old man said “Give me the lungs and kidneys.” The boy gave him those
parts and consumed the remainder himself. They laid down to sleep and in
the morning they again started on the sled track. About noon they came
to the tents of the Indians, and among them was the tent of the father
and mother of the little boy. The spirit placed the boy down on the
outside near the door of the mother’s tent and told him to go in. The
boy entered and saw his father and mother
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page343" id =
"page343">343</a></span>
sitting near the fire. The mother in astonishment said, “Husband, is
this not our little boy whom we deserted at our late camp?” The husband
asked the boy, “Who brought you here?” The little boy answered, “My
grandfather.” The mother inquired, “Who is your grandfather?” The father
asked, “Where is he now?” The boy replied, “He is sitting outside.” The
father asked his wife to look outside and see if any one was there. The
woman did so and informed him that “I&nbsp;see someone sitting there,
but I do not know who it is.” The spirit replied, “You should call me
somebody when you are <i>no one</i> to leave your child to perish.” The
husband directed his wife to invite the old man into the tent.</p>

<p>The spirit declined to enter. The father then asked the son to tell
him to come in. The boy went out and conducted the old man within the
tent. The latter seated himself across the fire (this is intended to
mean opposite the door but on the other side of the fire). They slept in
the tent that night, and when the little boy awakened he found all the
people preparing to snare deer. The people asked the little boy to
accompany them. He did so, and when he was ready to start he asked the
old man what part of the deer he should bring home for him. The old man
replied that he would enjoy the lungs better than any other part. The
boy promised to bring a quantity for him on his return in the evening.
Toward evening the boy returned loaded with choice bits for the old man
who had conducted him to his father and mother. While outside of the
tent he called to the old man, saying that he had brought home some food
for him. Hearing no reply he entered the tent, and not seeing the man he
inquired of his mother where the person was. The mother announced that
he had departed, but did not know where he had gone. It was late, but
the boy resolved to rise early and follow his track. He was up at
daybreak, and finding the track followed it until he observed the spirit
crossing a large lake which was frozen over. The boy cried out to the
old man to wait for him. The spirit awaited his approach. The boy said
to him, “Why did you go away when I had promised you some choice food?”
The spirit replied that it could not dwell among living people, as it
was only a spirit and that it was returning to its abode. The old man
advised the boy to return to his people. The boy did so, but the next
morning the desire to see the good old man seized the boy, and again he
started to find him. The other people then tied the boy to a tree and he
soon forgot his benefactor.</p>

<p>Two Indian men who had gone off for the fall and winter’s hunt were

food, so that when the depths of winter had approached and the cold was
intense they resolved to seek the camp of their friends. They were
provided with nothing but bows and arrows. The next morning they started
off and tramped all day without seeing a living thing. They made their
camp and lamented
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page344" id =

they had no food. They finally prepared to sleep, when one of them
remarked to the other, “To-night I shall dream of porcupines.” They
slept, and in the morning the one related that he had seen a lot of
porcupines around the tent while he was dreaming. They determined to
proceed, but the one finally thought if they would stop there for the
day and succeeding night they would have all the porcupine meat they
would want. They remained there that day, and in the middle of the night
they were aroused by a noise which proved to be porcupines gnawing the
bark from the tent poles. The one man said, “Slip out and kill some with
a stick;” but added, “Go out in your bare feet.” He went out barefooted
and killed two or three, and dashed back into the tent with his feet
nearly frozen. He stuck his feet into the hot ashes and told the other
man to bring in the animals. The other man did so, and began to prepare
the flesh for cooking. They ate one of the porcupines, and by daylight
were ready to begin their journey. They went idly along, shooting their
arrows in sport at anything they could see. They continued this
amusement until near sunset, when one exclaimed, “My arrow has struck
something; see, it is moving;” The other replied, “What can it be, when
it is sticking only in the snow?” The other said he would try and find
out what it was. He cautiously examined, and found when he began to dig
it out that the arrow had entered the den of a bear. So they scratched
away the snow and soon saw a long, black hair sticking out of the hole.
He jumped back and exclaimed, “It is some sort of animal with black
hair.” The other replied, “Let us try and get it out. It may be good to
eat.” They finally drove the bear out and soon killed it. They began to
skin it, which was soon done. One of the men then said, “It is too big
and ugly to eat; let us leave it.” The other, however, cut off a large
piece of fat and put it on the sled. They then prepared their camp, and
when morning came they started off and traveled all day. When night came
they made their camp and soon had a huge fire burning. One of the men
hung the piece of fat over the fire and the oil soon dripped into the
fire. It created such a nice smell that one of them said, “Let us taste
the fat; it may be good to eat.” They tasted it and found it so good
that they rated each other soundly for being so foolish as to leave such
nice flesh so far behind them. They resolved to return for it. So they
returned for the carcass of the bear, which was far behind them, and as
it had tasted so good they determined to lose no time in starting. They
went immediately, although it was now dark and very cold. They came to
the place where it had been left and discovered that the wolves and
foxes had eaten all the meat, leaving nothing but the bones. They were
very angry, and began to lay the blame each on the other for having left
it. They regretted they had left such meat for wolves and foxes. They
determined to proceed to where they had camped the third time. On the
way they became very thirsty, and, stopping at a creek to drink,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page345" id =

they drank so long that their lips froze to the ice of the water hole,
and they miserably perished by freezing.</p>

The starving wolverene.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>On the approach of winter a wolverene, which had been so idle during
the summer that he had failed to store up a supply of provisions for
himself, his wife, and children, began to feel the pangs of hunger. The
cold days and snowstorms were now at hand. The father one day told his
wife that he would go and try to discover the place where his brothers,
the wolves, were passing the winter and from them he would endeavor to
procure some food. The wife desired him not to remain away long, else
the children would starve to death. He assured her that he would be gone
no longer than four days, and made preparations to start early on the
succeeding morning. In the morning he started and continued his journey
until near night-fall, when he came to the bank of a river. On looking
at the ice which covered its surface he descried a pack of wolves
ascending the river at a rapid rate. Behind these were four others,
which were running at a leisurely gait. He soon overtook the latter
group, and was perceived by one of these old wolves, which remarked to
the others, “There is our brother, the wolverene, coming.” The animal
soon joined the wolves and told them that he was starving, and asked for
food. The wolves replied that they had none, but that the wolves in
advance were on the track of some deer and would soon have some. The
wolverene inquired where they would camp for the night. They told him to
continue with them on the track of the others until they came to a mark
on the river bank. The wolves, accompanied by the wolverene, continued
their way until one of the old wolves called attention to the sign on
the bank and proposed they should go up to it and await the return of
the others. They went up and began to gather green twigs to make a clean
floor in the bottom of the tent. This was no sooner done than the young
wolves (the hunters) returned and began to put up the tent poles. The
old wolves said they themselves would soon have the tent covering in
place. The wolverene was astonished at what he saw and wondered whence
they would procure the tenting and fire. The old wolves laughed as they
observed his curiosity, and one of them remarked, “Our brother wonders
where you will get the tent cover from.” The wolverene replied,
“I&nbsp;did not say that; I&nbsp;only said my brothers will soon have up
a nice and comfortable tent for me.” The wolves then sent him off to
collect some dry brush with which to make a fire. When he returned the
tent was already on the poles. He stood outside holding the brush in his
arms. One of the wolves told him to bring the wood inside the tent. He
entered and gave the brush to one of the young wolves (the leader of the
hunters). The leader placed the brush in position to create a good fire,
and while that was being done the wolverene wondered how they would
start the fire. One of the old wolves remarked, “Our brother wonders
where and how you will get the fire.” He made no reply, as one of the
young wolves (the leader) took up a kettle
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page346" id =
"page346">346</a></span>
and went outside to get some snow to melt for water, and returned with
it full of snow. He set the kettle down and sprang quickly over the pile
of brush and it started into a blaze in an instant. It was now an
opportunity for the wolverene to wonder whence should come the supply of
meat to boil. One of the old wolves said, “Our brother wonders where you
will get some meat to cook for supper.” One of the young wolves went out
and brought in a brisket of deer’s meat. As soon as the wolverene saw
the meat he asserted that he did not wonder about the source of the
supply of meat, but that he only wished there was some meat ready for
cooking. The meat was cut up and placed in the kettle and when it was
ready it was served out. The choicest portions were selected for the
wolverene and placed before him with the injunction to eat all of it. He
endeavored to consume it, but the quantity was too great even for him.
He, having finished his meal, was about to place the remainder on one of
the poles when a wolf, observing his action, told him not to place it
there or else the meat would change into bark. He then laid it down on a
piece of clean brushwood and when he suspected the eyes of the wolves
were not turned toward him he stealthily inserted the portion of meat
between the tenting and the pole. The wolves saw his action and in a few
minutes the wolverene became very sleepy and soon retired. One of the
wolves carefully displaced the meat from the pole, where the wolverene
had put it, and thrust in its stead a piece of bark. In the morning when
the wolverene awakened his first thought was of the remnant of food. He
reached up for it and found nothing but the piece of bark. The wolves
were on the alert and one of them said, “Did I not tell you it would
change into bark if you put the meat in that place?” The wolverene hung
his head and answered, “Yes,” and again laid down to sleep. By the time
he awakened the wolves had a second kettle of meat cooked. They desired
the wolverene to arise and eat his breakfast. The leader told him to
hasten with his meal, as he had discovered some fresh deer tracks. The
wolverene thought he would watch how they broke camp and see where they
put the tentings. He went off a few steps and while his back was turned
the tent disappeared and he failed to discover where it was secreted.
The animals then started off, the young ones taking the lead while the
four old ones and the wolverene followed leisurely behind. After they
had crossed the river the wolverene began to wonder where they would
halt for the night. One of the old wolves told him they must follow the
track of the leader and they would come to the sign made for the site of
the camp. They continued for the entire day, but just before sundown
they came across the bones of a freshly killed deer from which every
vestige of meat had been removed, apparently eaten by wolves; so the
wolverene thought he would stand a poor chance of getting a supper if
that was the way they were going to act. The party continued on the
track and soon came upon the mark for the tent site.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page347" id =
"page347">347</a></span>
The wolverene was glad to rest, but sat down and began to look ahead in
the distance for the returning hunters. After a few minutes he looked
around and saw the tent standing there. The wolves then sent the
wolverene for dry brush, while they gathered green branches for the tent
floor. He brought so small a quantity that it would not suffice. The
young wolves returned at the same time and they directed him to again
procure some brush. When he returned he found they had stripped all the
fat off of the deer meat, although, he had not seen them bring any when
they returned, and placed it around the inside edges of the tent. The
brush was put down and again the leader jumped over it and a bright,
crackling fire started up. The wolves then said to themselves in a low
tone of voice: “Let us go outside and see what our brother will do when
he is left alone with the fat.” They went outside and immediately the
wolverene selected the nicest and largest piece of fat and began to
swallow it. The wolves at the same moment inquired of him: “Brother, are
there any holes in the tent cover?” His mouth was so full, in his haste
to swallow the fat, that it nearly choked him. They repeated their
inquiry and the wolverene gasped out the answer, “yes.” The wolves then
said: “Let us go inside.” The wolverene sprang away from the fat and sat
down by the fire. They put on a large kettle of meat and soon had their
supper ready. They gave the wolverene all the fattest portions they
could find. Having eaten so much of the frozen fat he became so
violently ill, when the hot food melted the cold fat in his stomach,
that he vomited a long time, and was so weak that he became chilly and
shivered so much that he could not sleep. He asked for a blanket, but
one of the wolves placed his own bushy tail on the body of the wolverene
to keep him warm. The wolverene shook it off and exclaimed: “I&nbsp;do
not want your foul-smelling tail for a blanket.” So the wolf gave him a
nice and soft skin blanket to sleep under. When he awakened he announced
his intention to return to his family, as they would soon be dead from
hunger. One of the old wolves directed the younger ones to make up a
sledload of meat for the wolverene to take home with him. The wolf did
so, but made the load so large and long that the wolverene could not see
the rear end of the sled. When it was ready they told him of it, and, as
he was about to start, he requested they would give him some fire, as he
could not make any without. The leader asked how many nights he would be
on the journey homeward. He answered, three nights. The wolf told him to
lie down in the snow. He did so and the wolf jumped over his body three
times, but strictly enjoined upon him not to look back at the sled as he
was going along. The wolverene promised he would comply with his
instructions. After the animal had started and got some little distance
from the camp of the wolves he thought of the peculiarly strange things
he had witnessed while among those animals; and, to test himself, he
concluded to try the method of making a fire. He stopped, gathered
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page348" id =
"page348">348</a></span>
a quantity of dry brush and placed it as he had seen the wolves arrange
it. He then sprang over it and a huge blaze gave evidence of the power
within him. He was so astonished that he resolved to camp there. He
melted some snow and drank the water and retired to rest, without having
looked at the sled. The next morning he started early and made his camp
before sunset, as he was very tired. He gathered some brush and made the
fire by jumping over the pile of fuel. His supper was only some melted
snow which he drank and retired. In the morning he started to continue
his journey homeward and still had not seen the sled which he was
dragging. As he was ready to start he was so confident of his ability to
create fire that he threw away his flint and steel. He traveled all day
until toward sunset he was so fatigued that he concluded to make his
camp for the night. He was so elated with his newly acquired faculty of
making fire that he eagerly gathered a great quantity of dried twigs and
branches, until a large heap was before him. He jumped over it, and
turned round to see the flames creep up and watch the sparks fly. There
was not a sign of a blaze or a spark to meet his gaze. He again jumped
over it, and again, until he was so exhausted that he could not clear
the top of the pile, and at last he knocked the top of it over, as his
failing strength did not enable him to avoid it. The only thing left for
him to do was to return for his flint and steel, which he had so
exultingly thrown aside. The animal berated himself soundly for having
done such a silly trick. Not having seen the sled he was surprised to
find how quickly he regained the site of the camp of the previous night.
Having recovered his flint and steel he returned, and soon had a fire
started; but it was now near daylight. He resolved to start on his
journey as soon as he had some water melted for a drink. He began to
think how quickly he had made the trip for his flint and steel, and
concluded that the great length of the sled had been purposely made to
cause him unnecessary fatigue, as it could not be so very heavy, or else
that he must be extraordinarily strong. He determined to examine it, and
did so. He could not see the farther end of the load. He flattered
himself that he was so very strong, and concluded to continue his
journey. He attempted to start the sled, and found he could not move it
in the least. He upbraided himself for permitting his curiosity to get
the better of his sense. He removed a portion of dry meat and a bundle
of fat, and made them into a load to carry on his back. He placed the
remainder on a stage, and was about ready to start homeward to his wife
and children, whom he believed must be by this time nearly dead from
starvation.</p>

<p>He put the pack of meat on his back and set out. That evening he
arrived at his home, and as soon as his wife heard him her heart was
glad. He entered and informed the family that he had brought home a
quantity of meat and fat, and had procured so much as to be unable to
carry it all at once. His wife begged him to fetch her a piece of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page349" id =
"page349">349</a></span>
meat, as she was nearly starved. He went out and brought in a large
piece of fat. The wife devoured such a quantity of it that she became
very ill, and suffered all through the night. In the morning the
wolverene stated he would return for the meat which he had stored away
the previous day. He started in the early morning, so as to return by
daylight.</p>

<p>As soon as the wolverene looked upon the sled loaded with meat the
spell was broken. One of the old wolves ordered the young wolves to go
and destroy the meat and fat which the wolverene had left on the stage.
They eagerly set out on the track of the sled, and soon saw the staging
where the wolverene had stored the remainder of the food. When they came
up to it they fell to and devoured all but a few scraps of it. The
wolves then went away, and in a few hours the wolverene returned. He saw
what had happened and exclaimed: “My brothers have ruined me! My
brothers have ruined me!” He knew it had been done because he had looked
back at the sled, although strictly enjoined upon not to do so under any
circumstance. He gathered up the fragments which the wolves had left and
returned home. When he arrived there he informed his wife that his
brothers had ruined him, because they had eaten all the meat which he
had stored away while out hunting.</p>

The starving Indians.&mdash;</a></h6>

<p>A band of Indians, who had neglected to store away a supply of food
for a time of scarcity, were upon the point of starvation. An old man
who lived at a little distance from the camping place of the band, had
wisdom to lay by a good store of dry meat and a number of cakes of fat,
so that he had an abundance while the other improvident people were
nearly famished. They applied to him, begging for food, but they were
refused the least morsel. One day, however, an old man came to him
asking for food for his children. The man gave him a small piece of
meat. When the man’s children ate this food they began to cry for more.
The mother told her little boy to stop crying. He persisted in his
clamor until his mother asked him: “Why do you not go to the old
U´&nbsp;sets kwa nĕ&nbsp;po?” (the name means One whose neck wrinkles
into folds when he sits down). This old man heard the mother tell her
child to go to him, and muttered to himself, “That is just what I
want.”</p>

<p>The little boy went to the old man’s tent door, and lifting aside the
flap, said: “I&nbsp;want to come in.” He went in and the old man
addressed the boy by his own name, saying: “What do you want,
U´&nbsp;sets kwa nĕ&nbsp;po?” in such a kindly voice that the boy felt
assured. The boy said: “I&nbsp;am very hungry and want some food.” The
old man inquired in an astonished voice: “Hungry? and your meat falling
down from the stage?” The old man bade the boy sit down, while he went
out to the stage and selected some choice portions and brought them into
the tent and gave them to the boy. The old man then asked the boy if he
had a sister. The boy said that he had a father, mother, and one sister.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page350" id =
"page350">350</a></span>
After the boy had finished eating, the old man directed the boy to come
with him and see the meat stages. They went out and the old man said:
“Now, go home and tell your father that all of this food will belong to
you if he will give me his daughter.” The little boy went home and
repeated what the old man had said. The father signified his willingness
to give his daughter in marriage to the old man. The boy returned to the
old man and stated that his father was willing to give away his
daughter. The old man immediately went out, took some meat and fat from
the stage, and then cooked three large kettles of food. When this was
done he selected a suit of clothing for a man and two suits for women.
He placed the nicer one of the latter near his own seat, and the other
two suits directly on the opposite side of the fireplace (the place of
honor in the tent). He then told the little boy to call all the Indians,
adding: “There is your father’s coat, your mother’s dress, and your
sister’s dress. Tell your parents to sit where they see the clothing,”
pointing to the clothes intended for them, and the sister to sit near
the old man, pointing to his own place. The boy ran out and apprised the
people, together with his own relations. The boy returned to the old
man’s tent before the guests arrived. The boy’s father came first, and
the boy said: “Father, there is your coat.” The mother then entered, and
the boy said: “Mother, there is your dress.” The sister then entered,
and the boy pointed to the dress, saying: “Sister, there is your dress.”
All the other Indians then came in and seated themselves. They took two
kettles of meat and broke the fat into pieces and feasted until all was
consumed. The old man helped his wife, her father, mother, and brother
to the contents of the other kettle. When all the food was finished the
old man said to the boy, “U´&nbsp;sēts kwa nĕ&nbsp;po, go and set your
deer snares.” The old man went with him to find a suitable place. They
could find only the tracks of deer made several days previously. They,
however, set thirty snares and returned home. The next morning they all
went to the snares and found a deer in each one. The people began to
skin the deer and soon had a lot of meat ready for cooking. They began
to feast, and continued until all was done. By this time a season of
abundance had arrived.</p>

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
